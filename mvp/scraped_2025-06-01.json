      "content": "U.S. Special Envoy to the Middle East Steve Witkoff delivers remarks alongside President Donald Trump in the Oval Office of the White House on May 28, 2025 in Washington, DC. (Photo by Andrew Harnik/Getty Images) A new proposal for a Gaza ceasefire spearheaded by Donald Trump’s special envoy, Steve Witkoff, includes a 60-day initial truce, a “redeployment” of some Israeli occupation forces, and an exchange of captives, including ten living Israelis held in Gaza. It would also require the “immediate” delivery of humanitarian aid, including by the United Nations and the Red Crescent. Drop Site obtained a copy of the document, labelled a “term sheet” by Witkoff. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced today that Israel had accepted the proposal, asserting it would allow Israel to continue its war of annihilation. \"We agree to accept the outline that was conveyed to us tonight,” Netanyahu said. “We do not believe Hamas will release the last hostage, and therefore we will continue fighting until Hamas is destroyed, and we will not leave the Gaza Strip until all the hostages are in our hands.\" If finalized, the agreement would be personally announced by President Trump and states that Trump “guarantees Israel’s adherence to the ceasefire during the agreed-upon period.” “Witkoff would come to the region to finalize the agreement,” it states, and to “preside over the negotiations.” Hamas confirmed it had received the Witkoff proposal and said it “is responsibly studying it in a way that serves the interests of our people, provides relief, and achieves a permanent ceasefire in the Gaza Strip.” On Wednesday, Witkoff announced the U.S. was on the verge of sending the term sheet to Hamas and Israel for approval. “I have some very good feelings about getting to… a temporary ceasefire and a long-term, peaceful resolution of that conflict,” he said while standing alongside Trump in the Oval Office. Most concerning to Hamas, according to officials who spoke to Drop Site, is that the proposal contains substantive amendments to an “understanding” Hamas announced it had reached with the U.S. on Monday. On Tuesday, Hamas issued a statement it had reached “an agreement with U.S. envoy Steve Witkoff on a general framework that achieves a permanent ceasefire, a complete withdrawal of occupation forces from the Gaza Strip, the flow of aid, and the appointment of a professional committee to manage the Gaza Strip's affairs immediately after the agreement is announced.” The new Witkoff proposal, however, includes only vague language on whether the agreement would lead to a complete end to the genocide and a full withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza. “The President is serious about the parties’ adherence to the ceasefire agreement and insists that the negotiations during the temporary ceasefire period, if successfully concluded with an agreement between the parties, would lead to a permanent resolution of the conflict,” the document states. “The United States and President Trump are committed to working to ensure that good faith negotiations continue until a final agreement is reached.” The new draft also makes no mention of an independent committee to administer Gaza, a term Hamas said was in its original agreement with the U.S. “The proposed deal from the Israelis through Witkoff is extremely difficult to accept,” said a senior Hamas official to Drop Site. “There is no talk about the [ceasefire] deal from January 19. There is no talk about a return to the situation before March 2” when Israel abandoned the original ceasefire. The Hamas official said that there is no guarantee Israel would even respect the 60-day truce after its ten captives are returned in the first week of the deal. “They might launch the war again,” he said. “There are no guarantees to a permanent ceasefire, no guarantees for a permanent withdrawal.” The United States, Egypt, and Qatar, according to the term sheet, would guarantee the 60-day ceasefire as well as “for any agreed upon extension” and would “guarantee that serious discussions will be held on the necessary agreements for a permanent ceasefire and will make every effort to ensure the completion of the above mentioned negotiations.” First page of the new Witkoff “term sheet” obtained by Drop Site News. Second page of the new Witkoff “term sheet” obtained by Drop Site News. On Thursday, a senior Palestinian resistance figure told Drop Site that Hamas is still debating the language in the draft. He pointed out that the assurances about Trump’s commitment to a long-term ceasefire are not enforceable and that Israel repeatedly violates ceasefire agreements, including the January deal that Trump pushed through before his inauguration. \"Releasing half [of the living Israeli captives] within a week and then putting your hopes in Trump is not very reassuring,” he told Drop Site. Basem Naim, a member of Hamas’s political bureau, told Drop Site earlier this month that the group had received a direct commitment from Witkoff that two days after the release of U.S. citizen and Israeli soldier Edan Alexander, the Trump administration would compel Israel to lift the Gaza blockade and allow humanitarian aid to enter the territory. Witkoff, according to Naim, also promised that Trump would make a public call for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza and for negotiations aimed at achieving a “permanent ceasefire.” “He did nothing of this,” Naim said. “They didn't violate the deal. They threw it in the trash.” Hamas officials have consistently told Drop Site they will not agree to any proposal that does not include a clearly defined framework for a total end to the genocide and the withdrawal of Israeli forces. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said Israel will not agree to terms that prevent it from resuming its war of annihilation against Gaza. “There are a lot of reservations on this paper as a framework. There are a lot of loopholes. There are a lot of ambiguities,” a Palestinian source close to the negotiating team told Drop Site. “Israel will never agree to end the war under this framework. The number of aid trucks are not mentioned. There are no specifics about where the Israeli forces will withdraw to. All of these are problems which will probably impede this. Witkoff tried to accommodate Israel much more than what was in the earlier paper. It’s going to take some time before a deal gets approved by the movement.” Soon after the Witkoff draft was circulated, Israeli officials told several Hebrew language news outlets that the vague language in the draft would allow Netanyahu to resume the war after 60 days. A senior Israeli official, according to Ha’aretz, suggested that “U.S. officials deliberately crafted ambiguous language around the issue of ending the war to make the deal acceptable to both sides,” pointing out that the proposal “does not include a demand for Israel to end the war or withdraw from Gaza.” Speaking to YNet, Israeli officials said securing a partial deal for half the remaining living and dead captives is a victory for Israel that increases the chance of another partial deal because Hamas’s bargaining power will be reduced. “If there is an opportunity for a temporary ceasefire to return additional hostages, I would like to emphasize: We are ready for a temporary ceasefire,” Netanyahu said on May 21. Hamas officials told Drop Site that the group will not release more Israeli captives until there is a clearly defined framework for ending the genocide. Israeli officials also boasted to YNet that, under the terms of the Witkoff paper, “Israel is not giving up its strategic achievements,” claiming that the framework will allow Israeli forces to remain entrenched along the Philadelphi Corridor along Gaza’s southern border with Egypt. Under the agreement, aid would be sent into Gaza “immediately once Hamas agrees to the ceasefire agreement.” The process for allowing aid into Gaza is not completely clear, though the proposal does specify that the UN would be involved in distribution: “Whatever agreement is reached on aid to the civilian population will be respected throughout the course of the agreement. Aid will be distributed through agreed upon channels that will include the United Nations and Red Crescent.” It is not clear from the document if the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation would continue to operate or would be disbanded. The U.S. and Israeli-backed aid distribution mechanism has been denounced by the UN and dozens of international humanitarian organizations after going into effect this week in Gaza with disastrous results, including at least 10 Palestinians being killed by occupation forces. The ceasefire framework includes a schedule for the release of ten living and 18 deceased Israeli captives. Half would be released on the first day of the agreement and the rest on day seven. There are a total of 58 Israeli captives still being held in Gaza, 20 alive, 35 confirmed dead, and three whose status Israel says remains unknown. In exchange for Hamas releasing ten living Israeli captives, Israel will release 125 Palestinian captives with life sentences and 1,111 captives from Gaza who were detained after October 7, 2023. “The release will be performed simultaneously in accordance with an agreed mechanism and without public displays or ceremonies,” the document states. All Israeli offensive military activity would cease upon the agreement going into effect. During the initial 60-day ceasefire period, Israel would also cease all aerial movement, including surveillance, for between 10 to 12 hours daily. Crucial technical details are not outlined in the term sheet, including the point to which Israeli ground troops would be required to pull back. The proposal only states that troops would redeploy in northern Gaza and in the Netzarim Corridor on day one of the agreement based on maps that still need to be negotiated. Israeli troops in southern Gaza would redeploy under similar terms on day seven. According to the term sheet, “The technical teams will work out final redeployment boundaries during proximity negotiations.” Over 80% of the Gaza Strip is currently within an “Israeli militarized zone” or under active displacement orders, according to the UN. The terms for exchanging captives are consistent with the previous ceasefire agreement in January—one that Israel violated on a near daily basis and eventually abandoned entirely, imposing a full spectrum blockade on March 2 and resuming its genocidal military campaign in full force on March 18. In exchange for the release of 18 the bodies and remains of dead Israeli captives, Israel would release 180 dead Palestinian captives from Gaza. The proposal specifically bans any “public displays or ceremonies” during the release of captives. The document also states that on day ten of the ceasefire, Hamas would provide “complete information (proof of life and medical status report /proof of death)” on each of the remaining Israeli captives, while Israel would provide the same on Palestinian captives detained from Gaza since October 7. It does mention Palestinian captives detained by Israel in the West Bank, dozens of whom remain disappeared and their status is unknown. The proposal also calls on Hamas to commit “to ensure the health, welfare and security of the hostages during the ceasefire,” with no provision for Palestinian captives held by Israel. At least 70 Palestinians have died in Israeli detention over the past 19 months. Nearly 4,000 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza since March 18 alone, when Israel resumed its scorched-earth bombing campaign followed by an expanded ground invasion. Over 430,000 Palestinians have been forcibly displaced again over that time period. Meanwhile, a nearly three-month Israel blockade has left one hundred percent of Gaza’s population facing “high levels of food insecurity,” according to the UN, and the entire enclave is on the brink of famine. As Israel’s genocidal assault on Gaza crossed the 600-day mark on Wednesday, UNOCHA declared the humanitarian situation is “at its darkest point yet. As relentless, deadly bombardment and mass displacement intensify, families are being starved and denied the basic means of survival.” This story has been updated to include new comments from a Hamas official and another Palestinian source.

      "content": "Francois Burgat, a renowned French specialist on the Palestinian-Israeli conflict and political Islam, was acquitted on Wednesday by the criminal court of Aix-en-Provence, in southeastern France, where he was prosecuted on charges of “apology for terrorism” for messages posted on social media. The prosecution accused the former research director at the National Centre for Scientific Research and former director of the French Institute for the Near East, now retired, of a series of controversial social media posts concerning Hamas and Israel’s war on Gaza. During the trial in April, the prosecutor asked for an eight-month suspended prison sentence, a $4,500 fine, a six-month ban from social media and a two-year ineligibility period against Burgat. Speaking to Middle East Eye, Burgat praised a \"wise lucidity from the court\", but expected the prosecution to appeal. \"Let's hope that this wisdom, which several dozen of my compatriots convicted without any justification in the same type of case have not benefited from, will henceforth become the guiding principle of the French judicial system,\" he said. New MEE newsletter: Jerusalem Dispatch Sign up to get the latest insights and analysis on Israel-Palestine, alongside Turkey Unpacked and other MEE newsletters The case began with a post the scholar published on X (formerly Twitter) on 2 January 2024, where he shared a statement by Hamas following the publication of a New York Times investigation into sexual violence allegedly committed by the Palestinian group during its 7 October attacks in Israel. In the statement, Hamas rejected the accusations and denounced a \"Zionist attempt to demonise the [Palestinian] resistance\". ‘Let's hope that this wisdom... will henceforth become the guiding principle of the French judicial system’ - Francois Burgat \"Our fighters are fighters for freedom and dignity and cannot commit such shameful acts,\" Hamas said in the statement shared by Burgat. In response to internet users who condemned his post, the former academic wrote that he had \"infinitely more respect and consideration for the leaders of Hamas than for those of the state of Israel\". He then posted a page from one of his books explaining \"the context in which [his] respect and admiration for Hamas asserted themselves\". In an interview that week, he also declared: \"Just because I have to acknowledge that there was a terrorist movement on 7 October doesn't mean I have to criminalise the Palestinian liberation movement.\" For these comments, a complaint was filed by the European Jewish Organisation, a group founded in 2014 that has taken several legal actions for \"apology for terrorism\" in the name of fighting antisemitism and anti-Zionism. 'Apology for terrorism' row in France shows silencing of debate about Palestine Read More » In July 2024, Burgat was placed in police custody for seven hours following a report from the DGSI, the main French domestic intelligence service. A new charge was added in December 2024 after Burgat defended two individuals who were accused of launching a hate campaign that led to the killing of teacher Samuel Paty in October 2020 and convicted of complicity in terrorist assassination. Burgat wrote at the time that France had \"fallen outside the rule of law\" and criticised the ruling as meaning that \"we are all 'terrorists'.\" During his trial in April, when asked by the judge whether he thought \"Hamas is a terrorist movement\", the scholar replied that he had \"never congratulated” the group for the 7 October attacks. “On that day, [Hamas] committed acts that can be labelled terrorist; but we must not extrapolate to its entire history,\" he said. ‘Repressive climate’ Burgat told MEE he had asked ChatGPT if he had any chance of being convicted for \"apology for terrorism\". The artificial intelligence programme responded: \"Your comments, however critical or provocative they may appear in the public debate, generally fall within the scope of political and geopolitical analysis, which is protected by freedom of expression and research.\" ChatGPT concluded that \"a conviction is not likely, either legally or constitutionally,\" but offered a warning: \"However: The current political context (polarised around Islam, the Israeli-Palestinian conflict or secularism) can lead to manipulation or abusive prosecution, including against intellectuals.\" As an increasing number of people are being prosecuted worldwide for expressing their solidarity with Palestinians, Burgat's defence team denounced the prosecution as an attack on freedom of expression and the political manipulation of the justice system. \"There are two offences that are systematically charged against those who express their solidarity with Palestine: either incitement to hatred or apology for terrorism,\" Rafik Chekkat, one of Burgat’s lawyers, said. French teacher suspended over minute's silence tribute to Palestinians in Gaza Read More » In a message posted on X, Chekkat expressed hopes that \"this acquittal will lead to others\". \"I hope the decision regarding Francois Burgat will help change the repressive climate regarding Palestine and slow the pace of prosecutions for apology for terrorism,\" he said. Since October 2023, there has been a marked rise in the use of the \"apology for terrorism\" offence in France, with authorities launching hundreds of investigations into comments made about the war in Gaza, including by political figures such as left-wing France Unbowed (LFI) MP Mathilde Panot and future MEP Rima Hassan. Jean-Paul Delescaut, leader of the General Confederation of Labour union, was handed a suspended one-year jail sentence for writing in response to the attacks: “The horrors of illegal occupations… are receiving the responses they provoked.” On 18 June, Anasse Kazib, a railway worker and spokesperson for the Trotskyist political group Revolution Permanente, will also be tried for \"apology for terrorism\". On X, Kazib posted: \"Very happy for Francois Burgat, this is important news in the fight against the criminalisation of supporters of the Palestinian people. I hope that we will all be released tomorrow like François Burgat and that the repression against those who speak out against the genocide will cease.\" Burgat’s acquittal comes as France has adopted a much more critical stance towards Israel in recent weeks, with President Emmanuel Macron lobbying European powers to recognise Palestinian statehood at a UN conference next month and a growing number of public personalities using the term \"genocide\" to describe Israeli actions in Gaza.",

      "content": "Files reviewed by The Grayzone reveal a shocking foreign meddling scandal, as British state prosecutors are seen colluding with Israeli authorities to classify anti-genocide protesters as terrorists and imprison them on heavily politicized grounds. Documents released by the British government reveal that London has been coordinating with Israeli officials to prosecute protestors associated with activist group Palestine Action for disrupting the operations of Elbit Systems, which manufactures deadly weapons being used in the genocide in Gaza. The documents highlight a years-long Israeli influence campaign, and suggest that Tel Aviv’s meddling has prompted London to abandon well-established legal standards in order to charge anti-genocide activists under highly politicized counter-terror provisions. One especially revealing document shows the British Attorney General’s Office (AGO) furnishing their Israeli counterparts with guidance on how to avoid an arrest warrant for war crimes, reassuring them that the Crown Prosecutorial Service (CPS) “has strengthened the procedural safeguards around the issuing of private arrest warrants in recent years.” The Israelis have been on edge since former Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni was forced to cancel a trip to London in 2009 after a UK court issued an arrest warrant for her involvement in the blood-stained assault on Gaza that year. Leaked Israeli Ministry of Justice files revealed how Tel Aviv subsequently initiated an intensive – and ultimately successful – lobbying campaign to guarantee its officials “special mission” certificates which allowed them to visit London without the fear of arrest. As Declassified UK reported, the British government has granted Israel three special mission certificates through the Gaza genocide. Another startling file released by the British government revealed that Nicola Smith, the Head of International Law at Britain’s Attorney General’s Office, shared “contact details” for UK prosecutors and counter-terror investigators with Israel’s deputy ambassador to London. The email was sent to Israel’s deputy envoy, Daniela Grudsky Ekstein, with the subject line “Nicola Smith to Israelis re CPS/SO15 contact details,” indicating the UK government had referred Tel Aviv directly to the CPS, or Crown Prosecutorial Service, as well as to SO15, London’s counter-terror squad, to advance the prosecution of activists affiliated with Palestine Action. Smith’s email, sent on September 9, 2024, came less than two weeks after Ekstein and Smith held an in-person meeting on August 29, 2024, at Israel’s notoriously spy-infested embassy in London. The message is chummily addressed from “Nicky” to “Daniela,” suggesting warm relations between the two. Earlier that month, 10 Palestine Action activists were imprisoned after raiding an Elbit factory in Filton, South West England. They destroyed Israeli quadcopters constructed on the grounds. These small drones have been routinely used to maim and murder Palestinian civilians in the besieged Gaza Strip. Activists who demonstrated against Elbit are currently being detained under “counter-terror” powers, despite facing non-terror related charges such as criminal damage, prompting UN rapporteurs to issue a statement condemning their confinement. The CPS has indicated it will argue their offenses had a “terrorist connection” in order to maximize their sentences. The files released by the British government suggest the Israeli government has pushed for incarceration and prosecution of the Palestine Action demonstrators, who were known at the time as the “Filton 10.” The August 2024 rendezvous was not the first face-to-face interaction between Smith, the international law advisor to the UK AGO, and the deputy Israeli ambassador, Ekstein. A month beforehand, the two met alongside Israeli Embassy Counsellor of Political Affairs Yosef Zilberman and UK AGO Director Douglas Wilson. The back-to-back meetings hint at frequent coordination between the British and Israeli embassies – a notion reinforced by declassified emails reviewed by The Grayzone from May 2022 showing Israeli embassy officials in London secretly met with AGO representatives, including Wilson. Though records of the summit are redacted, it seems Tel Aviv was trying to interfere in ongoing cases against Palestine solidarity protesters. In a subsequent email to Israeli embassy apparatchiks, Wilson signed off, “I know from previous experience there is well-established direct contact between [our] legal teams, both between capitals and via our missions in New York.” Three months after AGO officials provided the Israeli embassy with contact details of the officers investigating the activists behind the raid of the Filton facility, ten more Palestine Action demonstrators involved in the action were arrested. Eight were subsequently charged and remanded in prison under the same counter-terror powers as the previous ten, and the group is now referred to as the “Filton 18.” If Israel was in any way responsible for this move, it would represent a clear breach of core CPS code, and another layer in what appears to be a major foreign meddling scandal. As the Service’s General Principle 2.1 explicitly states, British “prosecutors must be free to carry out their professional duties without political interference and must not be affected by improper or undue pressure or influence from any source.” Palestine Action cofounder Huda Amori has insisted that Tel Aviv is influencing the British prosecutions of anti-genocide protesters. “There is clear evidence showing continuous political and foreign interference in Palestine Action cases,” Amori told The Grayzone, and that “the ongoing prosecutions of journalists and activists who dare stand up for Palestine is politically motivated, and done under the influence of the Israeli embassy.” “Any violation of the independence of the judiciary is an abuse of process under the rule of law,” she continued. “Therefore, the prosecutions must be stopped and the prisoners freed.” Long-running secret collusion Emails obtained by The Grayzone show collusion between British law enforcement bodies, Elbit Systems, and the Israeli embassy in London has been ongoing for several years. On March 2, 2022, then-Home Secretary Priti Patel met with Elbit’s British CEO Martin Fausset. The meeting’s explicit objective was to reassure the international death merchant “that the criminal protest acts against Elbit Systems UK are taken seriously” by authorities in London. A briefing note for Patel outlined “key points to raise” with Fausset. “Palestine Action’s criminal activity is for the police to investigate,” one note stated. But while local law enforcement were ostensibly “operationally independent of government,” the document revealed that Home Office officials had “been in contact with the police about [Palestine Action].” The declassified record is heavily redacted, although an unexpurgated segment on “lines to take” during the secret summit directed Patel to “thank Martin for the work Elbit does in support of the British Armed Forces.” A subsequent internal email discussing the meeting was then dispatched to various senior Home Office “counter-terror” officials, including Michael Stewart, then-chief of Britain’s notorious PREVENT program. The email summarized the meeting and “immediate next steps as a priority.” Fausset was quoted complaining that “the protests Elbit were experiencing from Palestine Action were getting more and more severe,” with “well organised, funded and trained” protesters, and “a significant online effort to mobilise and train.” Patel was reportedly “deeply concerned about everything she heard,” and proposed a variety of measures be taken in response. Because the documents are heavily redacted, it is unclear what occurred at Patel and Fausset’s meeting. Prior to their discussion, not a single Palestine Action member had been convicted for targeting Elbit Systems. Just one month later though, the British state made the unusual step of appealing the acquittal of four activists who toppled a statue of slave trader Edward Colston in Bristol in June 2020. The perpetrators walked free after asserting human rights defenses, which had been employed by Palestine Action demonstrators to beat charges of criminal damage on previous occasions. However, in the Colston case, the court ruled that human rights defenses could only be relied on in cases of vandalism of public property, not in cases where criminal damage has been caused to private property. Because Elbit is a private company, the Attorney General’s Office used this determination to dramatically increase prosecutions of Palestine Action activists. ‘Terror’ accusations continue despite lack of charges The Grayzone has reviewed a declassified February 1, 2023 email sent by a redacted, presumably internal British government source to AGO Director Douglas Wilson, describing a meeting six days earlier between his office and several Israeli diplomats. “The meeting was at the Embassy’s request and covered a variety of topics,” first and foremost a “joint declaration” between London and Tel Aviv’s respective Ministries of Justice. It was presented by Israel’s then-Deputy Ambassador to Britain, Oren Marmorstein, now chief of the Zionist entity’s public affairs and media division. The declaration “sought closer bilateral cooperation between the two ministries on mutual areas of responsibility” – “namely, legislation and legal reform, civil and criminal law and legal education.” As this fell outside the AGO’s jurisdiction, Wilson “undertook to engage the relevant leads in the Ministry of Justice on this topic for them to engage with the [Israeli] Embassy.” This followed an email to Tel Aviv’s London-based diplomats in which British Justice officials promised they’d be “in contact with you shortly.” “The Attorney General would be delighted to meet with her Israeli counterpart if you have any suggestion of suitable dates for a meeting in London,” the email cheerily added. The interpretation that Tel Aviv influences British laws to the detriment of Palestine solidarity activists is reinforced by numerous sections of London’s National Security Act, which came into force December 2023. These passages give every appearance of being custom built to legally neutralize Palestine Action’s wrecking campaign against Elbit Systems. Priti Patel introduced the legislation in her capacity as Home Secretary. She was reinstated to government in 2019 after being forced to resign from a previous position in November 2017 for holding 12 secret meetings with Israeli officials without official authorization or notification. On April 19, 2023 Britain’s then-Policing Minister Chris Philp met with representatives of the AGO, Home Office, several police forces and bodies, Elbit Systems, and the company’s French arms supplier Thales, to discuss “Palestine Action criminality.” According to an internal readout, “Minister Philp opened the meeting [by] emphasising that the UK government wants to make sure that UK based business can continue in their lawful activity.” A representative of Elbit “gave an overview of Palestine Action (PA) attacks on initially Elbit and now their supply chain.” Due to heavy redactions, it’s unclear what decisions, if any, were made regarding prosecutions of activists. But if the prior meeting between Elbit and then-Home Secretary Patel was any indication, acquittal and conviction of Palestine Action members was likely a key subject of interest for attendees. During their March 2022 discussion, the British government openly acknowledged that Palestine Action “does not meet the threshold for proscription” as a terrorist group under British law, “as they do not commit, participate in, prepare for, promote, encourage, or otherwise be concerned with acts of terrorism.” The recent invocation of counter-terror powers to imprison Palestine Action demonstrators may indicate the British government has identified a legal fudge that allows authorities to treat the group as a terrorist entity, despite its lack of formal proscription. The Filton 18’s pre-trial detention period runs to 182 days, well in excess of typical limits for non-terror-related crimes. Their contact with the outside world is also severely restricted, again contrary to standard British jurisprudence. This May 1, British prosecutors inexplicably announced that “terrorism connections” would also be considered in the trial of 10 Palestine Action demonstrators who attacked Elbit supplier Instro Precision in June 2024. Again, the charges – aggravated burglary, criminal damage and violent disorder – did not fall under even the most expansive definition of terrorism. Such considerations, the CPS states, will only be explored at the point of sentencing. The documentation reviewed by The Grayzone strongly implies these unprecedented breaches of long-established legal standards directly result from an extensive campaign of Israeli influence and meddling. The mother of one imprisoned but as yet unconvicted Filton 18 activist told The Grayzone that revelations of AGO officials readily involving Israeli officials in the prosecution of her 21-year-old daughter Zoe made her “feel physically sick.” Zoe has now been in prison for eight months without trial. It will have been 15 months by the time her trial begins in November. “Zoe took direct action against Elbit Systems because she could not bear to see her country being complicit in a genocide,” said the jailed activist’s mother. “She saw the UK committing war crimes by arming Israel, so she took action to uphold international law. Now we know it’s that same unholy alliance between Israel and the UK that conspired to use UK counter terror powers against Zoe and the Filton 18.”",

These are just some of the items starving Palestinians have received after waiting hours in the punishing midday heat in war-ravaged Gaza. Since Tuesday, the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), a controversial US-backed group that has been approved by Israel to take over aid distribution in the enclave, has claimed - without providing any evidence - to have handed out just 14,000 food boxes to needy Palestinians - a fraction of what aid agencies say is needed to address the mass starvation unfolding in the strip. The new aid system, which limits food distribution to a small number of hubs guarded by American security contractors, seeks to wrest distribution away from aid groups led by the United Nations. The UN and other major humanitarian organisations have repeatedly criticised the new system, saying it won't be able to meet the needs of Gaza's 2.1 million people and allows Israel to use food control as a weapon to control the population. New MEE newsletter: Jerusalem Dispatch Sign up to get the latest insights and analysis on Israel-Palestine, alongside Turkey Unpacked and other MEE newsletters They have also warned of the risk of friction between Israeli troops and people seeking supplies. Israel, which rejects the criticism, has instead accused Hamas of stealing aid and says its blockade on the entry of food is partly aimed at preventing the group from diverting supplies. But Cindy McCain, the executive director of the World Food Programme and widow of US Senator John McCain, has rubbished such allegations, saying much of the aid that is being looted is being seized by destitute Palestinians. \"People are desperate, and they see a World Food Programme truck coming in, and they run for it,\" she told the US network CBS earlier this week. \"This doesn't have anything to do with Hamas or any kind of organised crime or anything.\" Chaos erupts as starving Palestinians storm US-backed aid facility in Gaza Read More » So far, only two of the four hubs Israel has announced are operational - both in the destroyed southern region of Rafah, where few Palestinians now live. Palestinians must go to these areas if they want to survive, and on Tuesday thousands walked from the tent camps outside the city of Khan Younis, crossing Israeli military lines, to reach the distribution points. At one point, chaos erupted as Palestinians overwhelmed a hub in Rafah, laying bare the scale of the catastrophe inflicted on the enclave by Israel's three-month blockade of aid. At least three Palestinians were killed and dozens more wounded as hungry men, women and children tried to get their hands on a box of food. Aid organisations have criticised the location of the sites, saying that the foundation is violating humanitarian principles by clustering them in one area, making them inaccessible to others across the enclave. According to the GHF, each of the boxes it distributes is intended to feed exactly 5.5 people and last 3.5 days. But several Palestinians have told Middle East Eye that upon receiving their box of aid they found the supplies to be woefully inadequate. While each box is different, most contained the following food items: 1 litre of oil 2kg of rice 4kg of flour 1kg of beans Four cans of tuna A jar of stuffed grape leaves A jar of apricot jam A box of biscuits 6 packets of spaghetti A box of tea bags None of the Palestinians MEE spoke to received bottled water, cooking fuel, medicines, blankets, soap, washing powder or menstrual pads. Additionally, none have reported receiving baby formula, baby food, nappies and essential supplies for babies and children to survive. \"We just want to feed our children,\" Abdullah Suleiman al-Sadudi, a displaced Palestinian who managed to secure a box of aid, told MEE on Wednesday. \"What are we supposed to do? Have mercy on us. This is wrong.\" Philippe Lazzarini, the head of Unrwa, the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, has also condemned the rations, calling Israel's model for provision a \"distraction from atrocities\". \"The model of aid distribution proposed by Israel does not align with core humanitarian principles,\" Lazzarini said on Wednesday. \"We have seen yesterday the shocking images of hungry people pushing against fences, desperate for food. It was chaotic, undignified and unsafe.\" A Palestinian man, who managed to get his hands on a box of aid, also lashed out at the new mechanism, told MEE that it deliberately put women and children in harm's way. Gaza Humanitarian Foundation: Israel's new model for weaponised aid Read More » \"We went and found children, women, heads of families all rushing in,\" he said. \"This mechanism is useless. Only the strong get something.\" The GHF was thrown into disarray earlier this week when its chief executive, Jake Wood, resigned a day before its launch, saying the organisation could not work in a way that adhered to \"humanitarian principles\". Incorporated in Switzerland earlier this year, the GHF's leadership remains opaque but it is believed to be run by a group of American security contractors, ex-military officers and humanitarian aid officials. The group has no experience distributing food in a famine zone and it remains unclear who is funding the organisation as both the US and Israel have denied pouring money into the company. Its leadership, meanwhile, has claimed to have more than $100m in commitments from a European Union government but has not named the donor. The GHF arrived in Gaza as international pressure mounts on Israel as malnutrition spreads throughout the enclave with dozens of children dying from starvation in recent days.",

      "authors": [

      ],
      "content": "In recent months, multiple new public opinion surveys have illustrated the extent to which Israel has lost Americans’ support. In early April, a poll from the Pew Research Center attracted widespread attention when it revealed that more than half of U.S. adults now express an unfavorable opinion of the Israeli state — an increase of over 10 percent since March 2023. And this month, after Israel launched a new military operation to occupy the entire Gaza Strip, a new poll from Data for Progress showed that 76 percent of U.S. voters support a permanent ceasefire in Gaza, and 51 percent think that U.S. President Donald Trump should demand one. These dramatic shifts come alongside several recent polls demonstrating that Gaza played a definitive role in the Democrats’ loss in the November U.S. presidential election. In February, a YouGov poll from the Institute for Middle East Understanding (IMEU) Policy Project found that the genocide was the leading reason cited by former Democratic voters who did not cast a ballot for former Vice President Kamala Harris. And beyond those “single issue” anti-genocide voters, new data analysis suggests that Democrats lost a larger population of voters — whose top concerns were rising inflation, the state of the economy, and other domestic issues — due to the demobilization effects of the Democrats’ failure on Gaza. In other words, more than by a rightward shift among Democratic voters, the November election was shaped by the fact that many of them simply sat it out. These findings add to the evidence not only that support for Palestinian rights and a Palestinian state are far higher than many within the political establishment have been willing to acknowledge, but that Democrats’ refusal to take these issues seriously has become a severe political liability. Yet over four months into the Trump presidency, even as it positions itself as the party defending democracy, the Democratic establishment has failed to respond to public sentiment and signal any serious shift in its support for Israel. At the beginning of April, for instance, Senator Cory Booker broke Congressional records with an over 25-hour speech on the Senate floor in April to protest the Trump Administration and “defend democracy”; two days later, he voted against two resolutions that would block billions of dollars in new weapons sales to Israel, shortly after it violated the ceasefire with renewed attacks on Gaza. Meanwhile, in the battleground state of Michigan, Attorney General Dana Nessel is fashioning herself as a leader in the anti-Trump democratic resistance. But she is drawing from Trump’s playbook when it comes to the Palestinian rights movement, even working against the actions of local law enforcement to target and intimidate pro-Palestine activists on college campuses. At an institutional level, too, the Democratic party has demonstrated no meaningful plans to change its position on Israel-Palestine — illustrated recently by the election of the new Democratic National Committee (DNC) Chair in February. Several pro-Palestinian advocacy groups pushed for a chairperson who would treat the November election as an indictment of the Democrats’ policy failures on Palestine, press the party to reconsider its unconditional support for Israel, and implement a plan to regain the trust of Arab, Muslim, and pro-Palestinian voters. Top DNC Chair candidates Ken Martin, Martin O’Malley, and Ben Wickler were hard to distinguish on this issue, despite two of them having expressed some regret over the barring a Palestinian speaker at the 2024 Democratic national convention. But Ken Martin, who was elected as the new chair, has a notable history of pro-Israel and anti-Palestinian positions, including condemning widespread chants of “from the river to the sea, Palestine will be free” as “extremist” and “disgusting.” While Martin may have other progressive political alignments as a former labor organizer, his “progressive except on Palestine” stances make clear that Democrats are still not reading the room. And as Democratic strategists gear up for a fight to take back a majority in Congress in 2026, this imperviousness to new data may have serious consequences. A ‘couchward’ shift There are a few ways to look at the drop in support for Democrats in the November election. To be sure, Democrats lost votes to the right and to left-leaning third party candidates, such as Jill Stein, as well as potentially to conservative third-party candidates. But evidence suggests the rightward shift was less significant than the “couchward” one: It turns out many Democratic voters simply did not vote or could not conscience a vote for the party’s status-quo candidate. Nationwide U.S. vote tallies show a 2.5 percent decrease in voter turnout, representing some 6.6 million fewer eligible voters participating in the election compared to 2020. Of those 6.6 million, roughly 40 percent were in strongly Democratic states, which represent the largest numbers of electoral college votes based on population. These states saw 2.6 million fewer votes for Harris in 2024 than for former U.S. President Joe Biden in 2020, only 690,000 of which are accounted for by votes for left-leaning third-party candidates. That drop is a sign of serious demobilization on the left — not a rightward shift. In swing states, most reports agree that Republicans primarily gained votes within Republican strongholds and suburban areas, but had largely stable turnout compared to 2020. However, most urban areas of swing states, which are Democratic strongholds, saw notable decreases in voter turnout. This includes Detroit, Philadelphia, Phoenix, and Atlanta — the largest cities in four key swing states. So while many have bemoaned the suburban Democrats who were moved by misleading media or ambiguous anti-incumbent sentiment related to the economy, the Democrats that felt demotivated most by a choice-less election were those in swing state urban areas, where support for and awareness of the Palestinian rights movement is strongest — and far more widespread than many polls captured. According to screening parameters in the YouGov-Underpin poll conducted right before the election, opposition to Israel’s genocide in Gaza was actually a top-four voting issue for 24 percent of swing state independent and Democratic voters. A Swayable randomized control trial related to Gaza also showed that reminding voters of the issue only depressed voter motivation in swing states. With repeated exposure to images of Palestinian children dismembered and slaughtered in the weeks before the election — even as such news was suppressed across outlets and social platforms — many voters simply refused the flawed dichotomy they were presented between Harris and Trump, and sat the election out. Palestine as a bellwether The degree to which Gaza was an intensifying issue on top of existing discontent cannot be underestimated. Several policy issues with the vast majority of Americans’ support, not only overwhelming Democratic support, had been left unresolved or stagnant under Biden. When Democrats held majorities across the legislative and executive branches, they failed to pass popular policies — securing common-sense gun control and universal background checks, passing universal paid leave and pre-K education, expanding the Supreme Court, cancelling student debt, or codifying reproductive rights — all while warning of the threat that Republicans posed to American democracy. Even when Harris became the Democratic standard-bearer, voters were counterintuitively told to expect more from a leader who simply promised more of the same. When considering the major role of anti-incumbent sentiment related to inflation in this election — and the overlap with strongly pro-Palestine sentiment — polling suggests a population as large as 8.4 percent of Democrats and independents in swing states were likely demobilized as they witnessed no deescalation in the genocide. Democrats needed a different candidate, at best, but more importantly, they needed to change policy on Gaza. This was not only a significant issue for voters, it was one of the few policies the Democratic administration had the executive power to change before election day. Now, as the new administration grows more authoritarian by the day, shifting public opinion on Israel and its imperviousness to U.S. or international law becomes a tell-tale sign of weakened democratic institutions. The inability of the opposition Democratic party to embrace a holistic critique of that attack on both democratic and international norms will only mar its ability to respond to and utilize social movements to counter an oligarchic, technocratic, and authoritarian future. Still, some Democrats are paving a way forward on support for Palestinian rights within a broader pro-democracy agenda. Pennsylvania Representative Summer Lee, another outspoken advocate for Palestinian rights, overwhelmingly defeated her opponent with almost 1.4 percent more votes than Kamala Harris in her blue district. In New York City’s mayoral race, State Assemblymember Zohran Mamdani’s popularity among progressive voters has raised him unprecedented funds as a candidate that openly supports Palestinian rights and opposes suppression of pro-Palestinian activism. Palestinian-American elected officials have also continued to maintain widespread support in their districts as they have pushed for legislation favoring a ceasefire in Gaza and acknowledging the repeated massacres of Palestinians — State Senator Iman Jodeh of Colorado and Representative Rashida Tlaib among them. With polls revealing significant declines in Americans’ support for the Israeli state, more Democrats may be emboldened to take similarly strong stands against the genocide in Gaza. Indeed, as pro-Palestinian free speech is used as a flashpoint for anti-immigrant suppression and the erosion of U.S. constitutional rights, the issue of Palestinian rights will continue to be a bellwether of the American political establishments’ ability to combat growing authoritarianism — and respond to American public opinion.",

      "authors": [
        "Prem Thakker"
      ],
      "content": "Mahmoud Khalil outside the gates of Columbia University’s campus on April 30, 2024. Photo by USA TODAY Network via Getty Images Mahmoud Khalil’s legal team is demanding answers as to where exactly the Trump administration got the idea to target him in the first place. The demands underscore the legal team's suspicion that federal officials coordinated with a network of outside anti-Palestinian groups to target Khalil and others over their pro-Palestinian speech. In a new Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request obtained by Zeteo, Khalil, a green card holder, and his legal team from the Center of Constitutional Rights seek information from several government agencies “that would document and expose the reported collaboration between federal officials and private, anti-Palestinian organizations who have identified, doxxed, and reported him and others for purposes of securing the deportation of student activists advocating on behalf of Palestinian human rights.” Khalil’s legal team says in the FOIA request that patterns of the administration's arrests “strongly suggest” it’s acting at the encouragement of organizations that appear to coordinate with each other to target those advocating for Palestinian rights, and that take credit whenever those people are apprehended. “The correlation is clear, and not a coincidence: to date, not a single reported revocation and detention of an individual based on pro-Palestine activism occurred absent prior doxxing by one of these groups,” the FOIA reads. In the FOIA request, his legal team lays out a timeline to support its requests for information and claims of possible collaboration: January 2025: Blacklisting and doxxing website Canary Mission (reportedly tied to the Israeli Ministry of Strategic Affairs) creates a profile for Khalil on their website. Late January: Militant pro-Israel group Betar USA identifies Khalil as one of its targets for deportation, posting on Twitter that ICE is “aware of his home address and whereabouts\" and that they \"have provided all his information to multiple contacts.” Early March: Pro-Israel activists reportedly meet with members of Congress seeking Khalil’s deportation; Ross Glick, then-head of Betar USA, says he discussed his deportation efforts with Sen. John Fetterman and the office of Sens. Ted Cruz – all of whom, Glick claimed, expressed support for his efforts. Glick also claims that members of Columbia’s board of trustees reported Khalil. March 6-7: Canary Mission posts a social media video targeting Khalil. “Documenting Jew Hatred on Campus” – a coalition of pro-Israel school alumni, faculty, and parents – posts Canary Mission’s page of Khalil on Twitter; the following day, it takes to Twitter to call on Secretary of State Marco Rubio to deport Khalil. Columbia affiliates David Lederer and Shai Davidai (a professor who was suspended from campus for alleged harassment) echo the calls to deport Khalil — prompting Khalil to send emergency messages to Columbia administrators asking for help. In March, Davidai told Zeteo that he “never had a direct line to the administration,” and even if he did he “would never use such influence to target an individual.” In online posts, Davidai called Khalil a “terrorist supporter” and suggested he should be deported, tagging Secretary of State Rubio. March 8: ICE arrests Khalil without a warrant, first wrongly saying his visa was revoked (he has a green card), then adjusting their claim to say his green card was revoked. March 9: Pro-Israel surveillance network Shirion Collective, which is based in Israel, posts a memo it sent to DHS on January 27, that “lays out the legal basis” to target Khalil. “⚠️ This is what removed Mahmoud Khalil,” the group says. March 13: Ryan Mauro, a staffer at Capital Research Center who published an October 2024 report calling on the government to “Deport terrorism-supporting foreign protestors,” publishes an op-ed smearing Khalil as a “terror threat,” and urges officials to consider his research to bolster the case to deport Khalil. The government subsequently cites Mauro in multiple filings in its case against Khalil. Khalil’s FOIA request also notes that many of these groups have conspicuously targeted other individuals before the administration subsequently arrested them, including Mohsen Mahdawi, Rümeysa Öztürk, Momodou Taal, Dr. Badar Khan Suri, and Efe Ercelik. Earlier this month, a federal court found that Ercelik’s detention was \"exclusively triggered” by Betar. In the FOIA, Khalil’s legal team requested the disclosure of any communications since January 1 between the DOJ, ICE, State Department, or DHS and the aforementioned groups — as well as other groups like “Columbia Alumni for Israel,” a group chat of alumni, professors, and parents that have sought to identify and arrest and deport pro-Palestine students. Additionally, the legal team requested records mentioning Khalil in Twitter communications, ICE’s “tip form,” and the DOJ’s complaint form. It also requested records or communications between the government and the offices of Sens. Fetterman and Cruz and Secretary Rubio between November 5 and April 1. A State Department spokesperson told Zeteo: “Given our commitment to and responsibility for national security, the Department uses all available tools to receive and review concerning information when considering visa revocations about possible ineligibilities.” Fetterman denied any involvement with Betar. “I do not support private organizations coming up with deportation lists, and in any event, I would never participate or assist in that,” he told Zeteo. Daniel Levy of Betar Worldwide said the group “proudly” provides “the names of students involved in pro-Palestinian protests with the US government while also compiling lists of anti-Zionists and sending their details to the Israeli government to prevent their entry into Israel. We proudly share our information with governments and interested parties worldwide.” The other groups listed in the FOIA, as well as DHS, the DOJ, Lederer, and Cruz, did not immediately respond to requests for comment. ‘Unconstitutionally Vague’ The Trump administration targeted Khalil through the use of a little-tested authority given to the secretary of state to deport people on the grounds that they “compromise a compelling United States foreign policy interest.” But on Wednesday, a federal judge in New Jersey ruled that the grounds are likely unconstitutional and that Khalil is likely to succeed on the idea that Rubio’s \"foreign policy” determination is \"unconstitutionally vague.\" Share Judge Michael E. Farbiarz wrote that “arbitrary enforcement is not just a danger when many people enforce the law. It can also be a danger when one person is given the job, if his determination veers too far away from the standard set down by Congress. Here, the Secretary’s did.” But Farbiarz stopped short of ordering Khalil’s release, saying his legal team needed to present further legal arguments about allegations the government has made that the Palestinian green card holder failed to disclose his membership in certain organizations on his visa application. Khalil remains in a Louisiana ICE detention facility – more than 1,000 miles away from home, his wife, and his newborn baby.

      "content": "Last Thursday, May 22, a coalition named Veterans and Allies Fast for Gaza kicked off a 40-day fast outside the United Nations in Manhattan in protest against the U.S.-backed Israeli genocide in Gaza. Military veterans and allies pledged to fast for 40 days on only 250 calories per day, the amount recently reported as what the residents of Gaza are enduring. The fasters are demanding: 1) Full humanitarian aid to Gaza under UN authority, and 2) No more U.S. weapons to Israel. Seven people are fasting from May 22 to June 30 outside the U.S. Mission to the United Nations, where they are present from 9:30 am to 3 pm, Mondays to Fridays. Many others are fasting around the U.S. and beyond for as many days as they can. The fast is organized by Veterans For Peace along with over 40 co-sponsoring organizations. Remarkably, over 600 people have registered to join the fast. Friends of Sabeel, NA is maintaining the list of fasters. Who will stop the genocide in Palestine, if not us? That is the question that the fasters and many others are asking. The U.S. government is shamelessly complicit in Israel’s genocide, and to a lesser extent the same is true for the European governments. The silence and inaction of most Middle Eastern countries is resounding. Lebanon, Yemen and Iran, the only countries to come to Palestine’s aid, have been bombed by Israel and the U.S., with the threat of more to come. Syria, another country that stood with Palestine, has been “regime changed” and handed over to former al-Qaeda / ISIS extremists. On the positive side, some governments are making their voices heard. South Africa and Nicaragua have taken Israel and Germany, respectively, to the International Court of Justice – Israel for its genocide, Germany for providing weapons to Israel. And millions of regular people around the globe have protested loudly and continue to do so. Here in the United States, Jewish Voice for Peace has provided crucial leadership, pushing back against the phony charges of “anti-semitism” that are thrown at the student protesters whose courageous resistance has spoken for so many. University administrators have been all too quick to crack down on the students, violating their right to freedom of speech, but even these universities have come under attack from the repressive, anti-democratic Trump administration. Peace-loving people are frustrated and angry. Some are worried they will be detained or deported. And many of us are suffering from Moral Injury, concerned about our own complicity. How are we supposed to act as we watch U.S. bombs obliterate Gaza’s hospitals, mosques, churches and universities? What are we supposed to do when we see Palestinian children being starving to death, systematically and live-streamed. Because our movement is nonviolent, we do not want to follow the example of the young man who shot and killed two employees of the Israeli Embassy in Washington, DC. But we understand his frustration and how he was driven to take forceful action. We take courage from the supreme sacrifice of U.S. Airman Aaron Bushnell, who self-immolated in front of the Israeli Embassy, asking “what would you do.” Student protesters at several universities around the country have initiated “hunger strikes,” often considered a protest of last resort. Now they have been joined by military veterans. “Watching hundreds of people maimed, burned, and killed every day just tears at my insides,” said Mike Ferner, former Executive Director of Veterans For Peace and one of the fasters. “Too much like when I nursed hundreds of wounded from our war in Viet Nam,” said the former Navy corpsman. “This madness will only stop when enough Americans demand it stops.” Rev. Addie Domske, National Field Organizer for Friends of Sabeel North America (FOSNA), said, “This month I celebrated my third Mother’s Day with a renewed commitment to parent my kid toward a free Palestine. As a mother, I am responsible for feeding my child. I also believe, as a mother, I must be responsive when other children are starving. Kathy Kelly, board president of World BEYOND War, also in NY for the fast, said, “Irish Nobel laureate Mairead Maguire, at age 81, recently fasted for forty days, saying ‘As the children of Gaza are hungry and injured with bombs by official Israeli policy, I have decided that I, too, must go hungry with them, as I in good conscience can do no other.’ Now, Israel intensifies its efforts to eradicate Gaza through bombing, forcible displacement, and siege. We must follow Mairead’s lead, hungering acutely for an end to all weapon shipments to Israel. We must ask, ‘who are the criminals?’ as war crimes multiply and political leaders fail to stop them.” Another faster is Joy Metzler: 23, Cocoa FL., a 2023 graduate of the Air Force Academy who became a Conscientious Objector and left the Air Force, citing US aggression in the Middle East and the continued ethnic cleansing in all of Palestine. Joy is a now a member of Veterans For Peace and a co-founder of Servicemembers For Ceasefire. “I am watching as our government unconditionally supports the very violations of international law that the Air Force trained me to recognize,” said Joy Metzler. “I was trained to uphold the values of justice, and that is why I am speaking out and condemning our government’s complicity in the ethnic cleansing of Palestine.” I spoke with VFP leader Mike Ferner on Day 7 of his Fast. The NYPD had just told him and the other fasters that they could no longer sit down in front of the US Mission to the UN on the little stools they had brought. But Mike Ferner was not complaining. He said: “We go home every night to a safe bed and we can drink clean water. We are not watching our children starve to death before us. Our sacrifice is a small one. We are taking a stand for humanity and we encourage others to do what they can. Demand full humanitarian relief in Gaza under UN authority, and an end to U.S. weapons shipments to Israel. This is how we can stop the genocide.” More information about how you can participate or support the fasters is available at Veterans and Allies Fast for Gaza.

      "content": "Aref Shamtan, 73, chose to erect a tent near his decimated home in northwest Syria instead of remaining in a displacement camp following the overthrow of longtime ruler Bashar al-Assad. “I feel good here, even among the rubble,” Shamtan said, sipping tea at the tent near his field. Upon returning with his son after al-Assad was toppled in December, Shamtan discovered his village of al-Hawash, situated amid farmland in central Hama province, severely damaged. His house had lost its roof and suffered cracked walls. Nevertheless, “living in the rubble is better than living in the camps” near the Turkish border, where he had resided since fleeing the conflict in 2011, Shamtan explained. Since al-Assad’s downfall after nearly 14 years of war, the United Nations’ International Organization for Migration reports that 1.87 million Syrians who were refugees abroad or internally displaced have returned to their places of origin. The IOM identifies the “lack of economic opportunities and essential services” as the greatest challenge facing returnees. Unable to afford rebuilding, Shamtan decided approximately two months ago to leave the camp with his family and young grandchildren, and has begun planting wheat on his land. Al-Hawash had been under al-Assad’s control and bordered front lines with neighbouring Idlib province, which became a stronghold for opposition groups, particularly Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, the opposition fighters that spearheaded the offensive that toppled the former president. Advertisement “We cannot stay in the camps,” Shamtan maintained, even though “the village is all destroyed … and life is non-existent,” lacking fundamental services and infrastructure. “We decided … to live here until things improve. We are waiting for organisations and the state to help us,” he added. “Life is tough.” Local official Abdel Ghafour al-Khatib, 72, has also returned after escaping in 2019 with his wife and children to a camp near the border. “I just wanted to get home. I was overjoyed … I returned and pitched a worn-out tent. Living in my village is the important thing,” he stated. “Everyone wants to return,” he noted. However, many cannot afford transportation in a country where 90 percent of the population lives in poverty. “There is nothing here – no schools, no health clinics, no water and no electricity,” al-Khatib said while sitting on the ground in his tent near what remains of his home. The conflict, which erupted in 2011 following al-Assad’s brutal suppression of antigovernment protests, killed more than 500,000 people and displaced half of Syria’s pre-war population either internally or abroad, with many seeking refuge in Idlib province. According to the International Organization for Migration, more than six million people remain internally displaced.",

      "content": "Joseph Kabila is visiting the eastern city of Goma, which has been seized by rebels, after he was stripped of immunity. Former President Joseph Kabila has returned to the Democratic Republic of the Congo, just days after he lost his immunity amid accusations he has helped armed rebels fighting in the eastern DRC, according to the Reuters and AFP news agencies. Kabila, on Thursday, was visiting the eastern city of Goma, which had been seized by the Rwanda-backed M23 militia along with several other areas in the resource-rich east of the country earlier this year. A team of AFP journalists saw Kabila meet local religious figures in the presence of M23’s spokesperson Lawrence Kanyuka, without giving a statement. Citing three unidentified sources close to Kabila, Reuters also said the ex-president held talks with locals in Goma. The visit comes despite the former president facing the possibility of a treason trial over his alleged support for M23. Earlier this month, the DRC Senate voted to lift Kabila’s immunity, paving the way for him to be prosecuted. The ex-president, who has been in self-imposed exile since 2023, denies the allegations and has slammed the charges against him as “arbitrary decisions with disconcerting levity”. On Thursday, a member of Kabila’s entourage told AFP that though no formal alliance existed between his party and M23, both shared the “same goal” of ending the rule of President Felix Tshisekedi. The United Nations and the DRC’s government say Rwanda has supported the M23 with arms and troops – an accusation the neighbouring country denies. The renewed violence has raised fears of igniting a full-blown conflict, akin to the wars that the DRC endured in the late 1990s, involving several African countries, which killed millions of people. Advertisement The current fighting has already displaced about 700,000 people this year, according to the UN. On Tuesday, Amnesty International accused M23 of committing abuses against civilians in areas under its control, “including torture, killings and enforced disappearances”. “These acts violate international humanitarian law and may amount to war crimes,” the group said in a statement. M23 says its goal is to protect ethnic minorities against the government in Kinshasa.",

      "content": "Peace talks between Russia and Ukraine have been rare since the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Part of the blame falls on Europe and the mainstream media for attempting to suffocate diplomacy. When the first bilateral talks occurred in the early weeks of the war, the West, led by the United States, Britain and Poland discouraged them and nudged Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky off the promising path of peace and along the path of war with promises of whatever Ukraine needs for as long as they need it. An initialed draft of a peace plan yielded to three years of war. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said that Russian President Vladimir Putin “should be pressured, not negotiated with” and told Zelensky that Ukraine should “just fight.” The Americans, rather than encouraging diplomacy that could have saved hundreds of thousands of lives, prevented the poisoning of international relations and prevented the real risk of World War III, ramped up military aid and provided Ukraine with the most advanced weapons NATO had to offer. Now there is hope of a resumption of those talks. Russian and Ukrainian delegations have met for the first time since those early talks for a first round of direct negotiations. And, once again, rather than nurturing them, Europe and the Western media are dismissing and suffocating them. Rather than throwing their influential weight behind Ukraine negotiating with Russia, Europe has pushed Ukraine to adopt maximalist terms that they know will force Russia to go on fighting. They try to convince the Trump administration that Putin is bent on conquering Europe and is only faking interest in peace. They push for more sanctions on Russia and more military aid for Ukraine. Instead of pushing for peace, Germany’s new chancellor, Friedrich Merz, said on May 26 that Germany had removed range restrictions on weapons sent to Ukraine, restrictions that his predecessor, like the United States, had insisted on to avoid crossing red lines that could draw NATO into war with Russia and into a third world war. Merz claimed that Britain, France and the U.S. had similarly removed restrictions on long-range weapons, allowing Ukraine to fire weapons deep inside Russian territory. Russia responded that “If such decisions have indeed been made, they are entirely at odds with our aspirations for a political resolution and with the efforts currently being made toward a settlement. “Quite dangerous decisions, again – if they were indeed made.” The Western media has discouraged and shaped public opinion against negotiating an end to the war with a three-pronged strategy. They first misleadingly inform the public that the first round of talks collapsed under the pressure of complete disagreement. They then claim that Russian President Vladimir Putin is demanding the end of Ukraine’s sovereignty. Finally, they argue that capitulation to Putin’s pressure under negotiations is unnecessary because Russia no longer has a decisive edge on the battlefield. Since the revelation that a draft peace treaty between Russia and Ukraine did exist, Western media outlets from The Wall Street Journal to The New York Times and, most recently, Reuters, have lined up to debunk the peace process and emphasize the distance and disagreement between the two sides that led to the failure of the talks. This chorus of misleading reporting never mentions that Oleksandr Chalyi, a member of Ukraine’s negotiating team, says that the two sides “concluded the so-called Istanbul Communique. And we were very close in the middle of April, in the end of April to finalize our war with some peaceful settlement.” Nor does it quote another member of the negotiating team, Oleksiy Arestovych, who says that the talks in Istanbul were successful and could have worked and that the Istanbul agreement was 90% prepared and that all that remained was that “question of the amount of Ukrainian armed forces in peacetime.” “We opened the champagne bottle,” Arestovych said. It buried that the Istanbul diplomacy resulted in a draft agreement that was initialled by the lead negotiators of both sides. It never mentions that Arestovych says that Zelensky “directly meeting with Putin… Was to be the next step of negotiations,” or that the final point of the Istanbul Communiqué states that “The parties consider it possible to hold a meeting on… 2022 between the presidents of Ukraine and Russia with the aim of signing an agreement and/or making political decisions regarding the remaining unresolved issues.” Arestovych fills in the blank by reporting that Zelensky and Putin were scheduled to meet on April 9, and a ceasefire was to take place. These are pretty significant omissions. Having highlighted the futility of negotiations, the mainstream media turns to their deceptiveness. Putin is not interested in peace, they insist. The talks are a political puppet show to accomplish Putin’s real goal: the subjugation of Ukraine and the destruction of its sovereignty. They insist, without evidence, that Putin’s insistence that negotiations address the “root causes” of the war, is code for “Russia’s demand for wide-ranging influence over Ukraine” that “would severely undermine Ukraine’s sovereignty.” There is nothing in the historical record that hints that this is what Putin identifies as the root causes of the war. The historical record clearly shows that Russia has always identified the root causes of the war as NATO’s encroachment toward their border and into Ukraine and the need for the protection of ethnic Russians in Ukraine. And the media knows this because NATO has admitted this. Then NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg has clearly stated that the “promise [of] no more NATO enlargement… was a pre-condition for not invade Ukraine.” And Ukraine’s chief negotiator in the Belarus and the first Istanbul talks has said that stopping NATO from expanding to Ukraine and Russia’s borders was the “key point” for Russia and that “[e]verything else was simply rhetoric and political ‘seasoning.’” Zelensky, himself, has said that the promise not to join NATO “was the first fundamental point for the Russian Federation” and that “as far as I remember, they started a war because of this.” This, too, is an important omission. Finally, after persuading the public that negotiations are a cover for Russia’s final takeover of Ukraine and that real diplomacy is impossible, the media then persuades its readers that diplomacy is also unnecessary. A not insignificant reason for negotiations is that Russia is determined to stop NATO’s march to its borders and to protect the rights of ethnic Russians living in Ukraine. They would likely prefer to accomplish this through diplomacy instead of through war and the loss of Russian lives, but they will not give up at the negotiating table what they increasingly seem to be able to win on the battlefield. The media, recently has launched a campaign to cast doubt on Russia’s edge on the battlefield to remove the urgency to negotiate. In a stunning article in The Atlantic, Anne Applebaum reports that “Ukrainians are confident that they can continue fighting, even without the same level of American support.” She may be the only analyst who believes that. She goes on to report that “the prospect [of continued war] no longer scares them” and that “Ukrainians now talk about the war” with “nonchalance” and “even humor.” Bloomberg reports that “Russian forces in Ukraine have made only small territorial gains this year amid steady resistance from Kyiv’s military, undercutting President Vladimir Putin’s assertions that his army has gained the upper hand in the war.” If Russia’s territorial advance has slowed, its edge in attrition, which is a more significant metric of success in this war, has not. Reasonable analysts have recently estimated that as many as three-quarters of a million Ukrainian soldiers are dead and another three-quarters of a million have been wounded severely enough that they will not return to the battlefield. At this rate of attrition, combined with Russian pressure and advances, they suggest that the Ukrainian armed forces could collapse in the next half a year to a year. Even The New York Times admits that Ukraine is running out of interceptor missiles for its Patriot systems, while Russia “upgrade[s] its arsenal,” including advances in hypersonic missiles that make them even “harder to intercept.” The Times goes on to concede that “In recent weeks, Russian advances have increased in a pocket of land between Pokrovsk and Kostiantynivka, two linchpins of the Ukrainian defense in the eastern Donetsk region.” Ukrainian soldiers even concede that Russia has taken the lead in the one area in which the Ukrainian armed forces may have once enjoyed an advantage. If Ukraine once “had a clear advantage” in drones, “now the Russians have at least parity, and in some areas a very significant advantage” (translation courtesy of Geoffrey Roberts),” including in a new kind of drone that is guided by fiber-optic cables that make them, unlike radio-controlled drones, impervious to electronic jamming. “I hope,” former head of the Ukrainian armed forces Valery Zaluzhnyi said on May 22, “that there are not people in this room who still hope for some kind of miracle or lucky sign that will bring peace to Ukraine, the borders of 1991 or 2022, and that there will be great happiness afterward.” Contrary to the European and mainstream media campaign, the 2022 bilateral talks in Istanbul show how close peace can be. The alternative to the resumption of talks is the continuation of war, a war that Ukraine is losing at an incomprehensible rate of loss of life. It is very hard to conceive of why Europe and the Western media are cheerleading for the second alternative.

      "content": "The US reopened the US ambassador’s residence in Damascus on Thursday as the Trump administration is building ties with the new Syrian government led by Ahmed al-Sharaa, the former al-Qaeda leader who led the assault that ousted former President Bashar al-Assad. “Our American flag rose proudly today over Damascus along with the rise of the hopes and aspirations of the Syrian people due to [President Trump’s] bold and courageous vision and decision on May 13th,” Tom Barrack, the US ambassador to Turkey and special envoy to Syria, wrote on X. Barrack was referencing President Trump’s decision to lift sanctions on Syria. The State Department recently issued a waiver for crushing sanctions that were imposed under the Caesar Act, which were designed to prevent Syria’s reconstruction and had a devastating impact on civilians. Barrack raising the US flag at the US ambassador’s residence in Damascus (photo via Barrack’s X account) “The President lifted onerous sanctions to allow Syria to determine its own future and has empowered [Secretary Rubio] to weave a new tapestry of foreign policy in the Middle East,” Barrack added. The US embassy in Damascus was shuttered in 2012 and remains closed. But the reopening of the ambassador’s residence is a sign that Washington may soon fully normalize relations with Damascus. Barrack also met with Sharaa at the Presidential Palace in Damascus and said the purpose of the meeting was “to launch a new phase in our relationship based on mutual respect and mutual interests.” He was present for the signing of a $7 billion energy deal, under which a consortium of US, Qatari, and Turkish companies will work to revive Syria’s power sector. One of the US’s main asks of the new Syrian government was that it pursue normalization with Israel. Since the regime change that ousted Assad on December 8, Israel has invaded southern Syria and has launched airstrikes across the country. But Israel has also been holding talks with Sharaa’s government, and Barrack suggested the two sides could sign a “non-aggression” agreement. “Syria and Israel is a solvable problem. But it starts with a dialogue,” Barrack told reporters in Damascus. “I’d say we need to start with just a non-aggression agreement, talk about boundaries and borders.” Barrack and Sharaa at the Presidential Palace in Damascus (photo via Barrack’s X account) Barrack’s talks with Sharaa, formerly known as Abu Mohammed al-Jolani, marked his second meeting with the Syrian leader within a week. Earlier this month, Sharaa met with President Trump, who described the former al-Qaeda chief as “a young, attractive guy” with a “strong past.” Barrack also said on Thursday that the US would remove Syria from the list of state sponsors of terror, saying that issue was “gone with the Assad regime being finished” even though Sharaa’s jihadist group that took power in Damascus, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), is still considered a terrorist organization by the US government. Sharaa got his start with al-Qaeda in Iraq, where he fought an insurgency against US troops before being imprisoned from 2006 to 2011. In 2012, he traveled to Syria and formed al-Qaeda’s affiliate in the country, the al-Nusra Front. In 2016, Sharaa claimed the al-Nusra Front was cutting ties with al-Qaeda. At the time, he thanked the “commanders of al-Qaeda for having understood the need to break ties.” In 2017, Julani merged his group with several other Islamist factions to form HTS, which the US State Department designated as a foreign terrorist organization in 2018. While Sharaa now presents himself as a moderate, HTS-affiliated forces have been responsible for the massacre of thousands of Alawites and other minorities since he took power, mainly in the western coastal areas of Syria.",

      "content": "Khaled Murad, 33, headed north from the central Gaza Strip toward a new aid distribution point he heard had opened up on Thursday, May 29th. When news reached Murad that the site was similar to the center that had begun distributing food boxes to residents in Rafah on Tuesday, he immediately made his way to the intended location northwest of the Netzarim Axis. When Murad arrived, he saw tens of thousands of people gathering to receive the aid. Before him was a large site equipped with the same metal gates and barbed wire fences that had been used in Rafah to contain the crowds and serve as entry points for lining up to receive the food parcels. Organized by the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), the U.S. contractor tasked by the Israeli army to distribute aid to Palestinians in place of the UN, the distribution site in Rafah had been overrun by the throngs of starving people who tore down the barbed wire fences in desperation to reach the aid. But this time, the aid distribution didn’t use the existing infrastructure. According to Murad, there did not seem to be any system in place. Murad saw the aid arranged on tables around the distribution point while people waited for the doors to open. The GHF’s U.S. employees, along with other site staff, stood armed and kept their distance from the aid, observing the scene without intervening. At 11:30 a.m., the gates opened to the people, as hungry men, women, and children who had walked long distances from central Gaza’s al-Bureij entered all at once, rushing toward the aid boxes on the tables. Each person carried what they could. Some were able to carry one box, some 10. “It was as if we were in a large chicken coop,” Murad told Mondoweiss. “It was as if they were throwing grain to the chickens. Whoever could get something, took it, and those who couldn’t returned hungry and disappointed.” “There was no way every chicken could get a grain of barley,” Murad added. Thursday marked the third day this week that the food distribution operation run by the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation devolved into chaos as too many people crowded through the site to obtain too little aid. The American company has been widely condemned by international aid agencies and the UN as complicit in the Israeli weaponization of aid for political aims, including using the aid as bait to lure Palestinians into concentrated ghettoes in Gaza to facilitate the Israeli army’s permanent occupation of the Strip and the displacement of its population. Three people were killed by Israeli forces during the incident in Rafah on Tuesday, while 48 were injured and another seven were reported missing. At least one case has been reported of a person being detained at the Rafah distribution center after failing to answer a question about a relative. The distribution of aid resumed on Thursday after being briefly suspended in the wake of Tuesday’s incident. The new center is located northeast of the Netzarim Axis, which separates north and south Gaza, and has been used as a major strategic military position for the Israeli army throughout the genocide. People headed to the aid center based on instructions sent to their mobile phones by the company. Contacting just a handful of families in Gaza, the news still spread like wildfire among the population in the area. Soon after, thousands flocked to the center. Imposed chaos Murad tried to arrive early to get something for his family, but when he got there, he was surprised by the large crowds and the scarcity of food. “The checkpoint was the size of a football field, with tables lined with food boxes and employees standing far away,” Murad said. “At around 11:00 a.m., one of the employees called out over the loudspeaker and told us that the food was on the tables and that we were allowed to enter.” “People rushed for the food, taking as much as they could,” he added. “There was no order, and it was complete chaos. I saw someone grab 10 food boxes, and I left empty-handed.” Despite the chaos that erupted, GHF employees were present but did not intervene to stop it or prevent people from taking more than their share, despite reports that some of them spoke Arabic in various dialects. “They were standing within eyeshot,” Murad explained. “We could see them, they could see us, and we could hear their voices, but there was no direct contact between us.” The displaced were surprised by the chaos and lack of organization, even though they went with their ID cards in anticipation of an ID-based distribution system. ‘People turned on each other as the Americans watched’ Since famine conditions began to return to Gaza following Israel’s total food blockade on the strip with the breakdown of the ceasefire in mid-March, a state of anarchy has emerged due to Israel’s policy of targeting Gaza’s police force and civil servants responsible for providing services to the population. This has led to the rise of armed gangs backed by Israel that loot aid trucks. The Israeli army has also targeted and killed Gaza government personnel protecting the aid. This policy of imposed chaos is now effectively being implemented on a small scale at the GHF aid distribution points. According to testimonies from the site north of Netzarim, the American company’s guards witnessed Palestinians using knives to steal food parcels from the hands of people who had already received them, without intervening. “At first, when there were food boxes, each of us was able to get one box,” Murad explained. “But when the boxes ran out and the number of people increased, people turned on each other as the Americans watched.” The chaos erupted at around 1:00 p.m., just as the food ran out and more people arrived in droves. “I was carrying a bag of flour and a box, but they were stolen from me, and I couldn’t protect myself,” Murad recounted. “There were people using knives and bladed weapons. They stole the aid right in front of the American mercenaries, and they didn’t do anything.” Several other witnesses have repeatedly reported accounts of theft from within the distribution point, also confirming that many people carried bladed weapons inside the center due to the lack of any inspection or identity verification mechanism. Omar Abed Rabbo, 33, was among those present at the center, but he was threatened by another man and forced to give up his food. “It happened to me personally when someone brandished a knife in my face and prevented me from entering where the food was being stored,” Abed Rabbo said. “He seized the boxes and transferred them to a cart. This happened in front of security personnel, who were wearing vests marked ‘American Security.’ But they didn’t break up the melee or intervene in the thefts.” Abed Rabbo said that the American mercenaries were only present at the perimeter “to protect the distribution point.” Abed Rabbo said that anyone seen with two boxes instead of one was immediately attacked. “This was especially true when people saw others carrying animal-drawn carts filled with food boxes and bags of flour,” he added. “After the food ran out, people kept demanding more, and the chaos increased, making it difficult for people to leave the checkpoint,” Abed Rabbo continued. “Sound grenades started falling among people, and then tear gas canisters, followed by some shots fired in the air.” Residents who spoke to Mondoweiss have not confirmed the source of the bombs and gunfire, but they say the American company employees “treated them with respect” and did not confirm that they were the ones firing the shots. Several residents claimed the Israeli army was responsible. Ahmad Jalal contributed to this report.",

      "content": "Dozens of people remain at the medical centre, the last functioning hospital in the north of the Palestinian territory. Israel has ordered the closure of al-Awda Hospital in northern Gaza, leaving health officials scrambling to relocate dozens of people who remain at the medical facility, as deadly bombardment and starvation rack the besieged enclave. At least 70 Palestinians were killed in Israeli attacks since the early hours of Thursday. The Gaza Health Ministry called Israel’s push, which forced the hospital out of commission, a “continuation of the violations and crimes” against the medical sector in the territory. Al-Awda was the last operating hospital in northern Gaza, according to health officials. Shutting down the hospital came amid continued Israeli forced displacement of Palestinians in Gaza, the latest order late on Thursday impacting large numbers of people north and east of Gaza City. “The Health Ministry calls on all concerned sides to ensure protection for the health system in the Gaza Strip, as guaranteed by international and humanitarian laws,” the ministry said in a statement. The World Health Organization (WHO) said 97 people, including 13 patients, are still at the hospital. The United Nations agency is planning a mission on Friday to transfer the patients to another facility. “Due to impassable roads, the hospital’s medical equipment cannot be relocated,” WHO said in a statement. “With Al-Awda’s closure, there is no remaining functional hospital in North Gaza — severing a critical lifeline for the people there.” WHO pleaded “for the hospital’s protection and staff and patients’ safety”. Advertisement Israel has been besieging and bombing hospitals across Gaza, killing more than 1,400 medical workers, as well as patients and the displaced taking shelter, since the beginning of the war, according to local authorities. ‘We haven’t seen any food or flour in five days’ The closure of al-Awda Hospital comes as the humanitarian crisis becomes more catastrophic by the day in Gaza, with Israel continuing its suffocating blockade on the enclave. An effort, backed by the United States and Israel, to distribute limited food supplies at specific sites run by a shadowy organisation, known as the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, continued to be marred by chaos on Thursday. “We have come a long distance, around 10km [6.2 miles] to take this box tainted with blood,” Palestinian resident Saher Abu Tahoon told Al Jazeera in central Gaza. “We need this box because there’s no food to eat. We haven’t seen any food or flour in five days. We went to get food for our children from a very faraway place. I can’t even carry this box because I am too tired, and I am too hungry.” Multiple explosions were heard and Israeli gunfire was reported near a distribution centre in central Gaza earlier on Friday. Reporting from Gaza City, Al Jazeera’s Hani Mahmoud said Palestinians who walked to the newly opened aid site at the Netzarim Corridor in central Gaza were unable to leave due to Israeli military activity in the area. “Many of the people who showed up at the site are trapped right now and unable to leave the area due to the presence of Israeli tanks and armoured vehicles [and] the ongoing shooting,” Mahmoud said. “They’ve been sending appeals to the Red Cross to coordinate their departure from the area. It’s becoming very risky for them to walk on their own.” Israel has been pushing to bypass and sideline the United Nations from the aid distribution process, a self-serving approach critics say would further weaponise humanitarian assistance in the territory. “The problems are that the insecurity continues, and frankly, they are not making it easy for us to deliver humanitarian goods,” Dujarric said. There are 600 aid trucks on the Gaza side of the Karem Abu Salem crossing (called Kerem Shalom by Israel), but Israel has blocked the world body from retrieving the supplies for the past three days, he added. Philippe Lazzarini, the head of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA), said “starvation is threatening the future of the children” in the Palestinian enclave. Advertisement “What’s urgently needed is a political will to allow the UN and partners to provide assistance at scale without hindrance or interruption,” Lazzarini said in a post on X. “Allow us to do our work.” Amid the dire humanitarian conditions, Israel maintained its relentless bombardment on Thursday, killing at least 70 Palestinians in attacks across Gaza, according to medical sources. The Palestinian Civil Defence said an Israeli strike on a residential building in Tuffah neighbourhood of Gaza City left approximately 30 people missing under the rubble. “Due to the lack of heavy equipment, it is not possible to recover the missing individuals from under the rubble,” the Civil Defence said in a statement. “Therefore, we call on the international community and human rights organizations for immediate and urgent intervention to protect civilians and innocent people in the Gaza Strip.”",

      "content": "Israel’s foreign minister has said that an arms embargo on his country would lead to the elimination of the Israeli state and “a second Holocaust”. Gideon Saar was speaking on Tuesday at an international conference on antisemitism in Jerusalem. \"If, God forbid, the calls and actions of countries and politicians for an arms embargo on Israel succeed, the result will be the destruction of Israel and a second Holocaust,\" he said. The comments came as Spain this week called on European countries to suspend arms shipments amid Israel’s ongoing siege on Gaza. At a meeting of the “Madrid Group”, Spain’s foreign minister called for an immediate suspension of Europe’s cooperation deal with Israel and an embargo on arms shipments. New MEE newsletter: Jerusalem Dispatch Sign up to get the latest insights and analysis on Israel-Palestine, alongside Turkey Unpacked and other MEE newsletters Germany, France, the UK, Italy, Egypt, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Morocco and Brazil were among those present at the meeting. “What is the meaning of actions or statements - by politicians or countries - to impose an arms embargo on Israel?” said Saar, in response. “If such moves succeed, Israel will simply be destroyed. There will be another Holocaust - on the soil of the land of Israel.” “This is essentially a way to deprive the Jewish people of the means to defend themselves. Means that they so lacked during the long years of exile and during the Holocaust.” The largest suppliers of weapons to Israel are the United States, Germany and Italy. Approved UK arms exports to Israel skyrocketed under Labour, data shows Read More » Several nations, including France, Spain and the UK, have either paused the supply of some weapons, or have suspended export licences. A report earlier this month found that the UK continued to send a wide range of arms to Israel even after the government suspended 30 arms export licences in September. The UK, France and Canada have threatened Israel with sanctions if it fails to stop its military operations in Gaza and immediately allow humanitarian aid to enter. \"We will not stand by while the Netanyahu government pursues these egregious actions,\" the countries said jointly on 20 May. \"If Israel does not cease the renewed military offensive and lift its restrictions on humanitarian aid, we will take further concrete actions in response.\" The three countries also urged Israel to halt settlements in the occupied West Bank, saying they are \"illegal and undermine the viability of a Palestinian state and the security of both Israelis and Palestinians\". In response, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu accused the three governments of emboldening Hamas and being “on the wrong side of justice”. Israeli attacks on Gaza have killed more than 54,000 Palestinians and wounded more than 120,000 since October 2023.",

Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi attends a news conference following his meeting with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov in Moscow, Russia, Friday, April 18, 2025 (AP) Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi responded to growing media speculation over a possible Iran-US agreement, emphasizing that while diplomacy remains Tehran’s preferred path, any deal must fully meet Iran’s conditions, chief among them the complete removal of sanctions and recognition of its nuclear rights. “Media is speculating about an imminent Iran-US deal. Not sure if we are there yet,” Araghchi posted on X on Wednesday. He affirmed Iran’s sincere commitment to a diplomatic solution that serves the interests of all parties involved. However, he warned that a resolution requires “an agreement that will fully terminate all sanctions and uphold Iran's nuclear rights—including enrichment.” Media is speculating about an imminent Iran-U.S. deal.

But getting there requires an agreement that will fully terminate all sanctions and uphold Iran's nuclear… pic.twitter.com/56u9elxLIj — Seyed Abbas Araghchi (@araghchi) May 29, 2025 This comes after CNN reported that talks between Washington and Tehran are close to reaching a comprehensive agreement that could be concluded during the next meeting, citing informed sources. CNN indicated that the next round of negotiations between Iran and the United States is likely to be held in the Middle East. Diplomacy must prevail, not media hype Araghchi reiterated that the road to any potential deal must go through formal talks rather than media narratives. “Path to a deal goes through the negotiating table and not the media,” he stated, in a clear rebuke to unverified reports suggesting progress toward a new arrangement between Tehran and Washington. Araghchi slams 'Israel' over disinformation Addressing what he described as recent “fake news” targeting Iran-US diplomacy, Araghchi accused \"Israel\" of using Tehran as a tool to discredit American voices critical of US foreign policy. “Using Iran to attack American critics is low, even for Israel,” he remarked, underscoring Tehran’s growing frustration with what it perceives as deliberate disinformation campaigns aimed at derailing diplomatic efforts. The comments come amid renewed international focus on Iran’s nuclear program and mounting regional tensions, particularly as diplomatic channels remain strained.

The call comes as a number of Israeli politicians voice their opposition to Israel's continued military operations in Gaza. “Israel must publicly and immediately accept the outline published this morning by American mediator Steve Witkoff,” Lapid posted on X. US envoy Witkoff's proposal involves the exchange of Israeli captives held by Hamas for Palestinians held by Israel and a temporary ceasefire that would lead to talks for an end to the conflict. “I remind Netanyahu: He has a full safety net from me to accept the outline, even if [National Security Minister Itamar] Ben Gvir and [Finance Minister Bezalel] Smotrich try to torpedo it.” New MEE newsletter: Jerusalem Dispatch Sign up to get the latest insights and analysis on Israel-Palestine, alongside Turkey Unpacked and other MEE newsletters Extreme right figures within Netanyahu's already far-right cabinet like Ben Gvir and Smotrich have conditioned their support of the Israeli prime minister on an expansionist position both in Gaza and the occupied West Bank. In remarks made while celebrating Israel's occupation of the old city of Jerusalem earlier this week, Smotrich doubled down on his intent to settle Gaza with Israelis and the expulsion of its Palestinian population. Smotrich calls for 'rebuilding temple' during Jerusalem Day celebrations Read More » \"We are conquering the Land of Israel, liberating Gaza, settling Gaza, and defeating the enemy,\" Smotrich said to crowds that had chanted \"death to Arabs\" as they marched through Jerusalem's Old City and attacked Palestinians. \"With God's help, we will expand Israel's borders, bring about complete redemption, and rebuild the Temple here,\" he said, referring to al-Aqsa Mosque, which settlers raided earlier on Monday. That posture has irked figures in Israel's centre, who are worried that the Netanyahu' government's aggressive posture on Gaza and Palestinians generally is threatening Israel's international standing. Last week, former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert condemned his country's actions in Gaza, accusing the government of killing innocent Palestinians. In a BBC interview on Tuesday, Olmert, who served as the prime minister of Israel from 2006 to 2009, said what Israel was doing in Gaza is \"very close to a war crime\". He told the network that the “obvious appearance” of the war on Gaza is that \"thousands of innocent Palestinians are being killed, as well as many Israeli soldiers,\" adding that \"from every point of view, this is obnoxious and outrageous. \"The war has no objective and has no chance of achieving anything that could save the lives of the hostages... We are fighting Hamas murderers, we are not fighting innocent civilians, and this must be clear,\" Olmert said.",

      "content": "Two of the largest federations of trade unions for oil workers in Brazil have called on the government to impose an energy embargo on Israel. The National Federation of Oil Workers and the Single Federation of Oil Workers sent a joint letter to President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva and key ministers in the Brazilian government on Wednesday, urging them to take more concrete action against Israel’s “genocide” in Gaza. Referring to comments made by Lula in February, the federations said that Brazil needs to go beyond public rhetoric and implement an energy embargo against Israel in accordance with its international legal obligations to prevent the “ongoing Nakba” - meaning ‘catastrophe’ in Arabic and referring to the mass displacement and dispossession of Palestinians in 1948 when Israel was created. In February, President Lula, while he was attending the African Union Summit in Ethiopia, accused Israel of committing “genocide” against Palestinians in Gaza and compared its war on Gaza with Nazi Germany’s extermination of Jews. The letter highlighted that 2.7m barrels of crude oil were exported from Brazil to Israel in 2024 alone, representing a significant portion of Israel's military fuel supply, and Brazil had a global responsibility to avoid complicity in war crimes, as articulated by legal experts and international judicial bodies. New MEE newsletter: Jerusalem Dispatch Sign up to get the latest insights and analysis on Israel-Palestine, alongside Turkey Unpacked and other MEE newsletters The letter cited action taken by other countries, such as Colombia’s suspension of coal exports to Israel, and global grassroots campaigns such as #BlockTheBoat, where dockworkers around the world have refused to load Israeli ships and cargo and transport arms to Israel. In the United States, Block the Boat was organised by the Arab Resource and Organizing Center in San Francisco. In addition to the immediate suspension of oil exports to Israel, the federations urge the Brazilian government to suspend projects with Israeli energy companies, and support United Nations-led sanctions and measures to hold Israel to account. Signatories said this was an opportunity for Brazil to “honour its diplomatic legacy, affirm its position on the right side of history, and ensure that its economic policies reflect its ethical and legal commitments to human rights and international law\". The Single Federation of Oil Workers is a national trade union, while the National Federation of Oil Workers is a trade union federation comprised of independently operating oil workers' unions. Diplomatic backlash to Lula’s comments Lula has been a longtime supporter of Palestine. His comment to reporters on 17 February in Ethiopia sparked a diplomatic backlash when he said that Israel’s actions in Gaza were not a war, \"It's a genocide\". 'What's happening in the Gaza Strip with the Palestinian people hasn't happened at any other moment in history. Actually, it has happened: when Hitler decided to kill the Jews' - Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, Brazilian president \"It's not a war of soldiers against soldiers. It's a war between a highly prepared army, and women and children,\" he said. \"What's happening in the Gaza Strip with the Palestinian people hasn't happened at any other moment in history. Actually, it has happened: when Hitler decided to kill the Jews.\" Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Lula’s Nazi Germany comparison was “disgraceful and grave”, while Foreign Minister Israel Katz said that Lula would be “a persona non grata in Israel” until he took back his comments. Lula refused to take back his comments and recalled Brazil’s ambassador from Israel. Reuters reported that his approval ratings fell from 54 percent to 51 percent after his comments. Lula also backed South Africa’s International Court of Justice case against Israel in January, which ruled that a “plausible genocide” was happening in Gaza. An official statement highlighted Lula’s role in the decision: “The president expressed his support for South Africa’s initiative to bring Israel before the ICJ to determine that Israel immediately ceases all acts and measures that may constitute genocide or related crimes under the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide.”",

      "content": "According to <I>Reuters</I>, Ukrainian spies hid the drones in wooden sheds that were loaded onto trucks and driven near bases deep inside Russia The Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) conducted a large-scale drone attack deep inside Russian territory on Sunday that targeted several Russian airfields. The Russian Defense Ministry said the attack targeted five Russian regions, including the Amur Oblast in Russia’s far east, which is over 3,000 miles from Ukraine, and a base in the Irkutsk Oblast, over 2,500 miles from the Ukrainian border. The attack also targeted the northern region of Murmansk and the western oblasts of Ivanovo and Ryazan. The Russian Defense Ministry said that “several aircraft” caught fire in Murmansk and Irkutsk and that the attacks were launched “in the exact proximity” of the airfields in the region. The Defense Ministry said the attacks were “repelled” in the other three regions. “No casualties were reported either among servicemen or civilians. Some of those involved in the terror attacks were detained,” the ministry said. A Ukrainian official told Reuters that the SBU was able to pull off the attack by hiding explosive-laden drones inside the roofs of wooden sheds. The sheds were loaded onto trucks driven near the bases, and the roof panels were lifted off by a remotely activated mechanism, allowing the drones to fly out. Screenshot of a video on social media that purports to show a drone flying out a truck near the Belaya airbase in Irkutsk, Russia Videos on social media show drones flying out of a truck near the Belaya airbase in Irkutsk. Ukrainian officials said the attack was planned for more than a year and claimed it destroyed 41 Russian aircraft, including TU-95 long-range bombers, though the number hasn’t been confirmed by the Russian side. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky described the attack as a “brilliant operation” in his nightly address. ” It took place on enemy territory and was aimed exclusively at military targets – specifically, the equipment used in strikes against Ukraine. Russia suffered truly significant losses – entirely justified and deserved,” he said. US and Ukrainian officials claimed that the Trump administration was not notified ahead of the attack, although the CIA is deeply involved with the SBU and helped build up Ukraine’s intelligence services following the 2014 US-backed coup that ousted former Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych. Also on Sunday, a Russian missile strike on a Ukrainian military training site killed 12 Ukrainian troops and wounded 60. Ukrainian officials said that on Sunday, Russia launched 472 drones at Ukraine overnight, marking the largest Russian drone barrage of the war. Both sides have dramatically stepped up their drone attacks in recent weeks despite the US push for peace talks. Russian and Ukrainian negotiators are expected to hold a second round of direct peace talks in Istanbul on Sunday.",

      "content": "On September 11, the United States Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit ruled in favor of Antiwar.com and against the FBI in the landmark case of Garris v. FBI (known as Raimondo and Garris v. FBI until Justin’s death), and the court ordered the FBI to destroy records it collected during its unlawful investigation of our editors. The case and decision were well-described in The American Conservative, Courthouse News, our local paper The San Francisco Chronicle, and the AP. The complete text of the decision makes for very interesting reading, and even better is the video of the hearing before the 9th Circuit judges. Justin’s column from August 22, 2011 provides his own unique perspective on the beginnings of the case. Originally published August 22, 2011 The phone rang. It was a beautiful Saturday afternoon and it was my day off. Sitting in my rather neglected garden, as the late afternoon light sparkled golden on the tops of the plum trees, I put down my book – the 1995 edition of The Year’s Best Science Fiction, edited by Gardner Dozois – with more than a little annoyance. I was smack dab in the middle of a short story, “Asylum,” by Katharine Kerr, a tale about a future military coup in the US, written from the point of view of a particularly earnest liberal with faintly radical leanings. The main character is a woman writer who is abroad when the generals take over, and is marked as an enemy of the state on account of her book, Christian Fascism: Its Roots and Rise. Her San Francisco office is raided and her files carted away. She gets a call from a friend before the coup plotters cut off all communications with the outside world: “It’s seven days in May – stay where you are!” She stays, but is tortured by the prospect of her daughter being in harm’s way: when communications with America are finally restored, she wrestles with the question of whether to pick up the phone and make a call that might endanger her daughter. After all, what if the Christian Fascists are listening? The phone kept ringing. I picked it up with annoyance: it was our webmaster, Eric Garris, telling me about this – FBI documents recovered through the Freedom of Information Act that detail surveillance of Antiwar.com, the staff, and specifically yours truly. A word about the authenticity of the documents and their provenance: they were posted on a public website, Scribd.com: their form, including the extensive redactions, the acronymic bureaucratese, and the lunk-headed cluelessness which dominates the FBI’s corporate culture, so to speak, combine to verify their authenticity. As to the content of these documents, one word describes them: bizarre. According to a memo stamped “Secret,” marked as “routine,” and dated April 30, 2004, we apparently drew the attention of the feds when we posted a copy of a “terrorist suspect list” [.pdf] which had been supplied by the US government to various corporate and governmental agencies, both here and abroad. These documents – including one posted on the web site of an Italian banking association – contained the names of those on a “watch list,” the product of an FBI operation dubbed “Operation Lookout.” The memo acknowledges the list “was posted on the internet” in “different versions,” but says the FBI “assessment was conducted on the findings discovered on www.antiwar.com.” These guys are using us a resource – so why haven’t they contributed to our fund drive? The April 30 memo – which was issued to FBI counterrorism offices in New York, Philadelphia, St. Louis, and San Francisco – is prefaced with the following rather ominous “administrative” note: “This document contains information obtained under the authority of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA), 50 U.S.C., Section 1801. Such FISA derived information shall not be used in any criminal proceeding, including grand jury proceedings …” FISA created a special secret court, to which the feds have to go to get approval from a judge to tap your phone, open your mail, and rifle through your garbage. This accounts for the large number of lengthy redactions that pepper the pages of this report. Sneaking around corners, and spying on Americans engaged in peaceful and legal activities, they don’t want anyone to know how closely they mimic the methods of totalitarian governments, After a paragraph of précis detailing the basic facts about Antiwar.com – its mission, personnel, and nonprofit status – the details of several database searches are enumerated. A search of the Universal Index (UNI) for antiwar.com “was negative,” however “a scan of the Electronic Case File (ECF) revealed numerous documents for [redacted] and antiwar.com.” This is apparently an index of documents, “intelligence,” and random rumors picked up by various FBI snoops. The information revealed about Antiwar.com is, naturally, redacted, although we are given a hint as to the origins of some of the dirt they have on us: “File 65T-HQ-1427774 serial 26, dated 04/14/2004, from the Counterintelligence Unit CD-4E/11869 to the Washington Field Office furnished Washington Field Office with information received by [next four lines redacted].” So who says we don’t have friends in Washington? The redactions are extensive. The next entry refers to another file in the FBI database and starts out in mid sentence: “…that he was in possession of a document which was written in Italian. This document specified that [redacted] was a suspect on an FBI list. The document contained[redacted] social security number, date of birth, and two previous addresses. [Redacted] was listed as [redacted] on a list dated 05/22/02. This document can be found at www.antiwar.com/justin/CI-08-02.pdf.” This almost certainly refers to one of my columns about the mysterious “Urban Movers,” the Israeli employees of a New Jersey moving company who were arrested on 9/11/01 on suspicion they had some connection to the attacks. Five Israeli nationals were arrested that day, and held for over three months, subjected to lie detector tests, and later deported back to Israel. The owner of the company, one Dominick Suter, and his wife, fled to Israel the day before the police raided the company’s office and hauled away cartons of evidence: the Suters are among those listed on the “terrorist suspect list.” That was the angle I pursued in my columns, and it looks like the FBI also took an intense interest in the Suters. The FBI’s intense interest in this “suspect list” verifies that, as I wrote on several occasions, it is indeed authentic. The “enclosures” accompanying the memo include two pieces written by me on the subject: one a piece I wrote for Chronicles magazine about the New Jersey incident, and another antiwar.com column which they wrongly attribute to some website styling itself as “Pravda” (a site which was never authorized to publish my work). While the FBI and the US government have long denounced the persistent stories [.pdf] of “Israeli art students” and “Urban Movers” conducting covert activities on Israel’s behalf in the US as an “urban myth,” their inclusion of Suter and his spouse on their “Operation Lookout” list and their apparent panic that I publicized this fact directly contradicts their denials. Here’s how the law enforcement resources devoted to “counterterrorism” are being spent: scouring for useful “intelligence” on Antiwar.com on the Internet turned up an article – title and author redacted – “reporting on the magnitude and value of American military and economic assistance to Israel” whose author cited “one of his sources of information as www.antiwar.com.” Aha! Evidence! But evidence of what? A report dated 11/13/2002 describes a peaceful protest at the gates of a military base in Britain, during the course of which someone handed out a leaflet citing my “Urban Movers” piece. Another report, detailing a meeting of the neo-Nazi National Alliance, apparently attended by one of their undercover agents, says “a member discussed a website, Antiwar.com,” as a way to “educate themselves about the Middle East conflict.” As if to provide a “balanced” view, the memo cites the website of the New York Jewish Defense League – an officially designated terrorist outfit – as including “harsh criticism” as well as photographs of Eric Garris and myself. Slowly, but surely, the author of this FBI memo is building a case: the document is written in the language of an indictment – but what are the charges? That Antiwar.com is widely read and cited? That we posted a publicly available document on the Internet, one that was published by Cryptome.org and others? That we are in league with neo-Nazis and are hoping to start a race war and initiate a reign of terror? Well, that’s just a warm-up, folks, because it’s worse than that: “File 17A-LA-234485 serial 55, dated 11/10/2003 indicated that on 10/27/2003, a special agent reviewed the computer hard drives of [several words redacted]. The review of two hard drives revealed visits to many websites between 07/25/2002 and 06/15/2003. One of the websites listed was antiwar.com.” Of course, we’re terrorists – yes, that must be it. Otherwise why would the FBI Counterterrorism Unit be taking such an interest in Antiwar.com? And the proof? Well, someone snared in one of their investigations actually went to our website – more than once! If that isn’t a good reason for the feds to set their dogs sniffing around our garbage cans, well then I don’t know what is. Following this “incriminating” tidbit are several redacted paragraphs, interspersed with one rather intriguing comment: “There are four FISA derived references [to Antiwar.com] located at Newark [FBI Office].” Only the serial numbers corresponding to the files in the FBI database are referenced: the rest is redacted, including what they discovered after searching DMV records. Under “Analyst Comments,” we are told that “the rights of individuals to post information and express personal views on the Internet should be honored, however” the “terrorist suspect list” we published is somehow “singular in nature and not suitable for public release.” Well, they should have thought of that before they released the list to that Italian bankers’ association and other Internet-accessible sources. Yet we aren’t dealing here with rational human beings: these are government snoops pursuing an ideologically-driven vendetta. From the implication that we’re engaged in illegal activities the memo segues easily into inquisitorial mode: “There are several unanswered questions regarding www.antiwar.com. It describes itself as a nonprofit group that survives on generous contributions from its readers. Who are these contributors and what are the funds utilized for?” The idea that the FBI is interested in identifying our contributors is probably not something I ought to be dwelling on in the midst of our fundraising drive: clearly the feds want to intimidate our supporters, but I have to ask: what in the name of the Constitution is the FBI doing investigating the contributors to a legal organization that is engaged in exercising its right to free speech, absent any evidence of criminal activity? In spite of the memo’s strenuous efforts to link us with terrorism, the “evidence” they present is laughable, strictly amateur hour – an embarrassment. Are these the people charged with protecting us? If so, these Keystone Kops are worse than useless: they’re downright dangerous. The next three lines of the memo are redacted, ending in “on www.antiwar.com,” and continuing: “If this is so, then what is his true name? Two facts have been established by his assessment. Many individuals worldwide do view this website including individuals who are currently under investigation and [next two lines redacted].” Justin is a name I adopted at the age of sixteen, when I decided I was going to be a writer; my Wikipedia entry contains all the information they’re seeking in that regard, as any sixteen-year-old could discover in a few seconds of Googling. But I guess it’s too much to expect the FBI can muster the investigative powers of an American teenager. They proved that on 9/11/01, and in this memo they prove it all over again. I saved the best for last: the “action” recommendations contained in the memo. While directing the Washington FBI’s Electronic Communication Analysis Unit (ECAU) to “further monitor the postings of website www.antiwar.com,” the San Francisco office – where both Eric and I lived at the time – is tasked with the following: “It is recommended that a PI be opened to determine if [redacted] are engaging in, or have engaged in, activities which constitute a threat to National Security on behalf of a foreign power.” Reading that, I could hardly believe my eyes. Yielding to a sudden need for fresh air, I went out into my garden and just sat there for a few moments, warming myself in the last rays of the setting sun. It all seemed so unreal. Was this really happening, or had I imagined the whole thing? I returned to my computer and read it again, just to be certain, and – sure enough – there it was, plain as the pixels on my screen: I was accused of being “a threat to National Security” and working “on behalf of a foreign power.” What “foreign power” would that be – Libertopia? Galt’s Gulch? On what evidence was this “preliminary investigation” opened – and is it continuing? We don’t know the answers to these questions because the FBI redacted a good deal of the information it released to the FOIA petitioner, an obscure blogger I’ve never heard of. If the feds have such evidence, then let them release it – instead of releasing heavily censored documents that simply make unsupported assertions. That this kind of systematic defamation is now part and parcel of our system of “law enforcement” makes a mockery of the idea that we live in a free society. We don’t, as this incident has brought home to be in a very personal way. That some idiotic overpaid FBI “analyst” is sitting around “analyzing” material that appears on Antiwar.com and concluding that we are engaged in activities “on behalf of a foreign power” is straight out of Bizarro World. Instead of tracking down criminals, and listening in on the communications of terrorists plotting violence against this country, they are sitting around reading my old columns, intercepting my emails, and listening to my phone conversations. This is at once depressing and frightening: depressing because one wonders: don’t these incompetents have any adult supervision? Frightening because the idea of some government sneak having full knowledge of my Internet hookups and my two-hour long conversations with my sister about the condition of her cats is the ultimate in creepiness. That the FBI is engaged in a campaign of defamation and intimidation aimed at this website is not at all surprising, and yet I still can’t accept it emotionally. We have done nothing wrong: indeed, it is the FBI which is clearly in the wrong. Their activities in regard to Antiwar.com are of dubious legality, and are an infringement of our rights to free speech and to organize on behalf of our ideas. We demand the FBI retract its defamatory and damaging accusations, cease all investigations of our legally protected activities, and – most important – reveal the nature and full extent of their trumped-up “investigation.” Are we still living in America – or are we living in a world very much like the one depicted in “Asylum,” where I have to worry about what I say and who I say it to, for fear of my government? It looks like the coup envisioned in that science fiction story has already occurred. Like the main character in “Asylum,” these days I pick up the phone with some trepidation: do I want to call this person and say that with Big Brother listening?

      "content": "There was a time when Benjamin Netanyahu appeared to have all the cards. The Palestinian Authority was largely passive, the occupied West Bank was relatively calm, Israel’s diplomatic reach was expanding, and the United States seemed ready to bend international law to accommodate Israel’s desire for complete control over Palestine. The Israeli prime minister had also, at least in his own estimation, succeeded in subduing Gaza, the persistently defiant enclave that had for years struggled unsuccessfully to break the suffocating Israeli blockade. Within Israel, Netanyahu had been celebrated as the nation’s longest-serving prime minister, a figure who promised not only longevity but also unprecedented prosperity. To mark this milestone, Netanyahu employed a visual prop: a map of the Middle East, or, in his own words, “the New Middle East.” This envisioned new Middle East, according to Netanyahu, was a unified green bloc, representing a future of ‘great blessings’ under Israeli leadership. Conspicuously absent from this map was Palestine in its entirety – both historic Palestine, now Israel, and the occupied Palestinian territories. Netanyahu’s latest unveiling occurred at the United Nations General Assembly on September 22, 2023. His supposedly triumphant address was sparsely attended, and among those present, enthusiasm was notably absent. This, however, seemed of little consequence to Netanyahu, his coalition of extremists, or the broader Israeli public. Historically, Israel has placed its reliance on the support of a select few nations considered, in their own calculus, to be of primary importance: Washington and a handful of European capitals. Then came the October 7 assault. Initially, Israel leveraged the Palestinian attack to garner Western and international support, both validating its existing policies and justifying its intended response. However, this sympathy rapidly dissipated as it became apparent that Israel’s response entailed a campaign of genocide, the extermination of the Palestinian people in Gaza, and the ethnic cleansing of Gaza’s population and West Bank communities. As images and footage of the devastating carnage in Gaza surfaced, anti-Israeli sentiment surged. Even Israel’s allies struggled to justify the deliberate killing of tens of thousands of innocent civilians, predominantly women and children. Nations like Britain imposed partial arms embargoes on Israel, while France attempted a balancing act, calling for a ceasefire while suppressing domestic activists advocating for the same. The pro-Israel Western narrative has become increasingly incoherent, yet remains deeply problematic. Washington, under President Biden, initially maintained unwavering support, implicitly endorsing Israel’s objective – genocide and ethnic cleansing. However, as Israel failed to achieve its perceived objectives, Biden’s public stance began to shift. He called for a ceasefire, though without demonstrating any tangible willingness to pressure Israel. Biden’s staunch support for Israel has been cited by many as a contributing factor to the Democratic Party’s losses in the 2024 elections. Then, Trump arrived. Netanyahu and his supporters, both in Israel and Washington, anticipated that Israel’s actions in Palestine and the wider region – Lebanon, Syria, etc. – would align with a broader strategic plan. They believed Trump’s administration would be willing to escalate further. This escalation, they envisioned, would include military action against Iran, the displacement of Palestinians from Gaza, the fragmentation of Syria, the weakening of Yemen’s Ansarallah, and more, without significant concessions. Initially, Trump signaled a willingness to pursue this agenda: deploying heavier bombs, issuing direct threats against Iran, intensifying operations against Ansarallah, and expressing interest in controlling Gaza and displacing its population. However, Netanyahu’s expectations yielded only unfulfilled promises. This raises the question: was Trump deliberately misleading Netanyahu, or did evolving circumstances necessitate a reassessment of his initial plans? The latter explanation appears more plausible. Efforts to intimidate Iran proved ineffective, leading to a series of diplomatic engagements between Tehran and Washington, first in Oman, then in Rome. Ansarallah demonstrated resilience, prompting the US on May 6 to curtail its military campaigns in Yemen, specifically the Operation ‘Rough Rider’. On May 16, a US official announced that the USS Harry S. Truman would withdraw from the region. Notably, on May 12, Hamas and Washington announced a separate agreement, independent of Israel, for the release of US-Israeli captive Edan Alexander. The culmination occurred on May 14, when Trump delivered a speech at a US-Saudi investment forum in Riyadh, advocating for regional peace and prosperity, lifting sanctions on Syria, and emphasizing a diplomatic resolution with Iran. Conspicuously absent from these regional shifts was Benjamin Netanyahu and his strategic ‘vision’. Netanyahu responded to these developments by intensifying military operations against Palestinian hospitals in Gaza, targeting patients within the Nasser and European Hospitals. This action, targeting the most vulnerable, was interpreted as a message to Washington and Arab states that his objectives remained unchanged, regardless of the consequences. The intensified Israeli military operations in Gaza are an attempt by Netanyahu to project strength amidst perceived political vulnerability. This escalation has resulted in a sharp increase in Palestinian casualties and exacerbated food shortages, if not outright famine, for over two million people. It remains uncertain how long Netanyahu will remain in power, but his political standing has significantly deteriorated. He faces widespread domestic opposition and international condemnation. Even his primary ally, the United States, has signaled a shift in its approach. This period may mark the beginning of the end for Benjamin Netanyahu’s political career and, potentially, for the policies associated with his horrifically violent government.

      "content": "Nineteen months into the war on Gaza, more than 300 British artists, doctors, activists and academics have signed an open letter urging British Prime Minister Keir Starmer to end UK complicity in potential war crimes and broker an immediate and permanent ceasefire. The prominent public figures have also demanded that the prime minister suspend all UK arms sales to Israel. \"We urge you to take immediate action to end the UK’s complicity in the horrors in Gaza,\" the letter starts. \"Violence stamped with UK inaction - flown with parts shipped from British factories to Israel, could be obliterating families in seconds. Each arms shipment makes our country directly complicit in their deaths.\" Amongst the signatories are actors Benedict Cumberbatch, Brian Cox, Toby Jones and Andrea Riseborough; film director Danny Boyle; broadcaster Gary Lineker; singer-songwriter Dua Lipa and Holocaust survivor Stephen Kapos New MEE newsletter: Jerusalem Dispatch Sign up to get the latest insights and analysis on Israel-Palestine, alongside Turkey Unpacked and other MEE newsletters The main demands outlined in the letter urge Starmer to suspend UK arms sales and licences to Israel, ensure full humanitarian access across Gaza without military interference, broker an immediate ceasefire, and put an end to the starvation wrought on the besieged enclave. \"Over 15,000 children have already been killed - including at least 4,000 under the age of four. Bedrooms where children once slept, kitchens where families shared meals, schools where they learned - all reduced to rubble while Britain stands by,\" the open letter read. \"History is written in moments of moral clarity. This is one. The world is watching and history will not forget. The children of Gaza cannot wait another minute. Prime Minister, what will you choose? Complicity in war crimes, or the courage to act?\" Since the start of the war on Gaza, the Israeli military has killed more than 54,000 people, the majority of them children and women, and wounded more than 123,300 people. The Government Media Office in Gaza reported on Wednesday that more than 18,000 children are estimated to have been killed over 19 months of Israeli attacks, including 16,854 confirmed deaths. Among the children killed, 916 were under one year old; 4,365 were aged one to five; 6,101 were between six and 12; and 5,124 were aged 13 to 17. Starvation and lack of humanitarian aid The signatories have condemned the total Israeli blockade of the Gaza Strip that has left the population facing acute hunger. They stressed that the UK must ensure \"full humanitarian access across Gaza for experienced aid organisations without military interference.\" \"Right now, children in Gaza are starving while food and medicine sit just minutes away, blocked at the border. Words won’t feed Palestinian children - we need action... Mothers, fathers, babies, grandparents - an entire people left to starve before the world’s eyes,\" the letter said. What's inside the boxes of aid being distributed in Gaza? Read More » \"290,000 children are on the brink of death - starved by the Israeli government for more than 70 days. They cry until they can’t cry anymore - until hunger takes even their voices. And their parents are left to do the unthinkable: hold them, and wait.\" Israel sealed off Gaza’s borders on 2 March, blocking the entry of all international aid and goods, including basic food items, hygiene supplies, and fuel. On 1 April, all 25 bakeries supported by the World Food Programme across the Gaza Strip shut down due to the lack of wheat flour and fuel. Since Tuesday, the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, a controversial US-backed group that has been approved by Israel to take over aid distribution in the enclave, has claimed to have handed out just 14,000 food boxes to Palestinians - a fraction of what aid agencies say is needed to address the mass starvation unfolding in the strip. The new aid system, which limits food distribution to a small number of hubs guarded by American security contractors, seeks to wrest distribution away from aid groups led by the United Nations. The Israeli military on Tuesday fired shots in the area outside a GHF distribution site, as Palestinians waiting for aid briefly rushed inside the facility due to long delays conducting security checks on recipients. Israeli gunfire killed three and wounded at least 47 others. The UN and other major humanitarian organisations have rejectly the new system, saying it won't be able to meet the needs of Gaza's 2.1 million people and allows Israel to use food control as a weapon to control the population.",

      "content": "Perhaps you’ve heard: not only is Moscow about to maraud its way through Ukraine, not only is Tsar Vladimir I seeking a new Eurasian empire, but – as if to add insult to injury – Russia is \"returning” to Africa in a big way, intent on \"displacing\" the influence of the continent’s apparently rightful influencers (interesting language, that – no?). Anyway, at least that’s the hyper-panicked Russophobic narrative emanating from America’s top think tanks, papers of record, and bipartisan but paltry politicians. Naturally it’s almost all brazenly bunk – but hey, what else is new. Still, call me crazy, but a touch of truth – or at least reasonably sound critical analysis – seems appropriate before the cries of Washington’s (and Paris’s) in-house Chicken Little’s cause the drop of, if not the sky itself, plenty of new munitions and military men down upon Africa. Let us begin, as is often oh so illustrative, with some of the language being thrown about. Take a February 2nd brief from the Brookings Institute – typically considered the “top think tank in the world” year in and year out – titled \"The future of Russia-Africa relations.\" This oft-considered credible and prestigious outfit just so happens to be funded, to the tune of many millions, by the likes of the French and Qatari embassies, defense contractors like Booz Allen Hamilton and Northrup Grumman, the US State Department, and George Soros’s Open Society Foundation – all of which have a stake in America’s African adventures. Furthermore, Brookings’ current president is none other than retired Marine Corps four-star general John Allen, and counts such hyper-hawks as Robert Kagan, Michael O’Hanlon, and Fiona Hill on its staff – plus Biden-bunch national security players like Emily Horne, Amanda Sloat, Rush Doshi, and Mara Karlin among its alumni. Suppose it’s no surprise, then, that Brookings’ latest brief is chock full of euphemism, hypocrisy, and glaring omissions straight out the gate. Sentence one (Part one): \"Russia has been aggressively pursuing its strategic objectives in Africa in recent years.\" Has it now? That sounds an awful lot like what Washington has done with exponentially increased intensity – and far greater human/fiscal resources – since September 2001. Oh, and, correct me if I’m wrong – but Moscow, unlike the Pentagon, hasn’t carved out a distinct geographic African military command (USAFRICOM in 2008) and appointed a neo-imperial uniformed proconsul to organize operations on the continent. By the way, said command’s website includes a mission statement that states – clear as day, and unapologetically, that its purpose is \"to advance US national interests.\" Sentence one (Part two): Russia, through its ostensibly nefarious actions, is \"promoting alternatives to democracy as a regional norm.\" Well, sure – foreigners frankly do that when they meddle in lands thousands of miles from home. Bet the good ole USA – and its French friends – do a far better job at that whole democracy-promotion thing though, huh? Hardly. On top of a Washingtonian and Parisian penchant for propping up strongmen, plus training and advising local security forces who flagrantly abuse human rights – there’ve now been nine U.S.-trained African officers who’ve went coup-crazy since 2008. Since 2010, in fact, there’ve been six coups by US military minions in just two key West African countries – Mali and Burkina Faso (one of the Malian fellas pulled off two in the span of nine months!) Sentence four: To gain influence, \"Russia relies on…mercenaries\" (so does the US, the West, and all the rest), \"arms-for-resource deals\" (check), \"opaque contracts\" (says the country that lost hundreds of billion of dollars in Afghanistan alone), \"election interference\" (do nine coups – even assuming they’re indirect – by our proxies count?), and \"disinformation\" (uh, the Pentagon hides US troop numbers and locations from the public and even many members of Congress, so…) Sentence five: \"Russia’s Africa-focused initiatives are typically concentrated on propping up an embattled incumbent or close ally: Khalifa Haftar in Libya\" (that any different from Haftar’s next door neighbor, and murderous dictatorial coup-artist – Egypt’s al-Sisi, recipient of America’s second largest annual military aid package?), \"Faustin Archange Touadera in the Central African Republic\" (true – but what of Franco-America’s favorite, and way longer-serving monster: Chad’s Idris Deby?), \"and coup leader Colonel Assimi Goita in Mali\" (he of US military training, that is). Get the point? Not to say that any or all of what the Russians – or most external powers – are doing in Africa is exactly on the up-and-up, but when this sort of linguistic nonsense emanates from Washington’s top think tanks it only solidifies the increasing international suspicion than American hypocrisy truly does know no bounds. Always Absent: Context, Contrast, and Perspective Here, as ever, some key facts and figures get in the way of Washingtonian rhetoric. Without taking too deep of a dive, consider a small batch that compare – and perspectivize, so to speak – America’s Russo-African alarmism. Despite recent reports about Russian flag-waving at anti-Western (mainly anti-French) rallies in Mali and Burkina Faso, African perceptions of Moscow are at best middling. According to a 2021 poll, only nine percent of Africans listed Moscow as the outside power for which they held the most positive image. Russian trade with Africa is relatively modest and pales in comparison to American or (gasp!) Chinese commerce with the continent. Africa accounted for just 2.1 percent of Moscow’s global trade in 2018, and had an overall African balance of trade that was one-fifth of Washington’s and one-thirteenth of Beijing’s. Besides, more than 60 percent of Russia’s continental commerce was with just three countries – Egypt, Algeria, and Morocco. Militarily, whilst Wagner Group Russian private security contractors are active in Africa (so are American, French, British, and South African elements, just for starters), Moscow’s military operations and relationships are quite limited. Sure, Russia has active security-related agreements with 43 African countries. Then again, the US counts 176 such agreements with 49 African states. African states. In fact, official, uniformed, Russian military operations are almost nonexistent in Africa, and even its military assistance programs are comparatively minimal. The only exceptions are Moscow’s marginal missions in Libya and the Central African Republic. A Rand report – rarely packing the pacifism, those – notes that \"the remaining examples of Russian training activities on the continent are quite limited and episodic.\" It goes on to contrast this with the US, \"which averages more than $150 million per year in individual and collective training to partners in the USAFRICOM area of responsibility.\" (That, of course, leaves out the billions in straight-up military aid shipped to Egypt’s dictatorship each year, since Sisi’s fiefdom falls under the purview of USCENTCOM – Washington’s Mideast proconsul). The exact number of troops Moscow has deployed in Africa is difficult to determine, but likely amounts to – at most – a few hundred. What we do know – despite AFRICOM’s best efforts to conceal it – is that both Washington and Paris station some 6,000 soldiers on the continent apiece, Germany has about 1,100 in place and even Italy has had about 450 deployed (in Libya). know – despite AFRICOM’s best efforts to conceal it – is that both Washington and Paris station some 6,000 soldiers on the continent apiece, Germany has about 1,100 in place and even Italy has had about 450 deployed (in Libya). Russia, following a trend that also applied (even more so) to the Soviet Union, does lead the way in weapon’s sales to Africa – but even this is deceptive. In 2018, it shipped more than $2 billion worth of arms Africa’s way, compared to about $600 million American and $100 million in Chinese sales. That said, nearly 90 percent of those weapons went to just two countries – Egypt and (more so) Algeria. That’s hardly the continent-wide arms-bonanza of Western imaginations – and not a notable change from past patterns. In terms of total global assistance – development, humanitarian, and military – America sent 400-times as much funding Africa’s way in 2017. So much of this entire Russian \"return to Africa\" affair is so much exaggerated hullabaloo. Even the Rand Corporation – essentially the DOD’s in-house think tank and research institute – concluded (in a report specifically for AFRICOM’s Air Force component, AFAFRICA) that \"there is little evidence that the Kremlin has a grand plan for Africa,\" because \"the continent remains peripheral to Russian grand strategy.\" The Rand study goes on to state, categorically even, that: \"in sum, our analysis indicates that Russian involvement will not be uniformly problematic for AFAFRICA.\" In the end, count on African agency to – once again – surprise all those Western, Russian, and Chinese would-be masters of the universe, who treat the continent like just one theater in a global boardgame of Risk. My guess, and hope, is the continent’s citizenry, leaders, and elites alike will ultimately throw a wrench in the best laid plans – or neo-imperialist fantasies – of these foreign frenemies. This prediction recalls the words of then-Tanzanian President Julius Nyere way back in 1965 – when Moscow, Washington, and Beijing were previously parrying for continental control: \"We will not allow our friends to choose our enemies.\" Sorry, Brookings – and amen to that!

      "content": "The Syrian army’s failure to repel a modest opposition attack on Aleppo in December, which ultimately culminated in the collapse of the regime of Bashar al-Assad, defies explanation. The opposition’s military strength and its use of drones were contributing factors, no doubt, but they were hardly enough. The Syrian army had previously reclaimed vast swaths of territory from rebel forces. By the summer of 2024, Assad’s government controlled two-thirds of the country. The sudden unraveling and the conventional explanations behind it belie what unfolded beneath the surface of the military event itself. In a previous interview with New Lines, a high-ranking Syrian officer, who recounted the final days of the regime’s existence, disclosed a revealing detail that I decided to spend some time pursuing. A closer examination revealed it to be the key to understanding the regime’s collapse from a different angle, not merely as a logistical or battlefield failure, but as the result of a silent, invisible war. The snippet of information was this: A mobile application, distributed quietly among Syrian officers via a Telegram channel, had spread rapidly in their ranks. In truth, the app was a carefully planted trap, the opening salvo of a hidden cyberwar — perhaps one of the first of its kind against a modern army. Militias had weaponized smartphones, turning them into lethal instruments against a regular military force. Beyond revealing the contours of a cyberattack against the Syrian army, this investigation seeks to understand the application itself, its technology and reach, and to uncover the nature of the information it siphoned from within military ranks. This, in turn, leads directly to the potential impact on Syria’s military operations. The larger question remains: Who orchestrated the cyberattack, and to what end? The answers may point to players within the conflict itself — factions of the Syrian opposition, regional or international intelligence services, or other, still unseen hands. In any case, the attack must be understood within its full political and military context. In February 2020, a mobile phone left behind by a Syrian soldier inside a Russian-made Pantsir-S1 air defense vehicle helped to turn the entire system into a fireball. Israeli forces tracked the phone’s signal, pinpointed the battery’s location, and launched a swift airstrike that obliterated the system before it could be rearmed. The incident, revealed by Valery Slugin, the chief designer behind the Pantsir system, in an interview with the Russian news agency TASS, showed how a single mobile phone could trigger catastrophe, whether by design or by sheer ignorance. The consequences were devastating: critical equipment and personnel were lost at a moment when the army could least afford it. The soldier responsible — a survivor of the Israeli strike — may have been an informant or a recruited agent or, more likely, had no grasp of the damage he had caused. According to Slugin, all communication devices, such as phones or radios, should have been shut off during operations, and the battery location changed immediately after launching missiles to avoid detection. These are standard security protocols. Yet the Syrian crew’s failure to follow them turned an ordinary phone into a beacon, a live marker that guided the enemy’s strike straight to its target. By the basic logic of military science, the Syrian authorities should have launched a full investigation after the Pantsir’s destruction — banning mobile phones within the ranks or devising countermeasures to stop them from becoming roving surveillance nodes. But that never happened. The Syrian army, this time and many times after, behaved with the same fatal irresponsibility — and paid for it dearly. What was most striking after the events of Nov. 27, and the fall of Aleppo to the opposition, was how suddenly the Syrian army ceased to fight. Most units simply watched as opposition forces advanced, offering little more than sporadic resistance until the rebels reached the outskirts of Damascus on the morning of Dec. 8. In the rural areas of Idlib and Aleppo, opposition factions swept past dozens of positions belonging to brigades of the 25th and 30th Divisions, as well as narrow outposts in hilly terrain. They covered more than 40 miles in just 48 hours. By then, the Syrian army was a shadow of its former self. After a decade of grinding warfare, marked by tens of thousands of casualties and irreparable material and moral losses, there was little strength left to rally. Years of conflict had left the forces battered not just by battlefield defeats, but by a more insidious collapse from within: The Syrian pound’s freefall, from 50 pounds to the dollar in 2011 to 15,000 in 2023, had turned soldiers’ and officers’ salaries into a cruel joke — barely $20 a month. Many no longer fought for “the country and the leader,” but simply to survive. Transportation costs had doubled; the salary of a high-ranking officer could no longer feed a family. One officer from the 47th Regiment recalled that they often received only half of their scheduled meals, made up of half-raw, unprepared food. In many units, a privileged few officers dined separately, which fueled bitter resentment among the rank and file. Beyond the economic collapse, worsened in part by Western sanctions, Syria had, by 2018, sunk into a deep military and political stagnation. Fronts grew paralyzed. Morale sagged. Commanders reinvented themselves as smugglers of Captagon and fugitives. Meanwhile, the regime clung stubbornly to power, rejecting even the most pragmatic solutions, whether offered by yesterday’s enemies among Arab states, by Turkey or by the West. The stagnation, and the suffocating sense of a future foreclosed, birthed a grotesque kind of entrepreneurship within the army. Officers and soldiers no longer focused on military duties; they scrambled for any opportunity that might sustain them. They traded anything and everything just to stay alive, without exaggeration. Imagine an army where officers sold the remains of stale bread rations meant for their men. Where senior officers bought solar panels and rented out charging services to soldiers desperate to light their shelters or charge their phones. It seems those who thought to weaponize this moment knew exactly what they were looking at — and what they could exploit. In the early summer of 2024, months before the opposition launched Operation Deterrence of Aggression, a mobile application began circulating among a group of Syrian army officers. It carried an innocuous name: STFD-686, a string of letters standing for Syria Trust for Development. To Syrians, the Syria Trust for Development was a familiar institution: a humanitarian organization offering material aid and services, overseen by Asma al-Assad, Bashar’s wife. It had never ventured into the military sphere. None of the officers or sources we spoke to could explain how the app found its way into army hands. The likeliest explanations point to collusion by compromised officers — or a sophisticated deception. What lent the app its credibility was that its name and information were publicly available. To heighten its aura of authenticity, and to control its spread, the app was distributed exclusively through a Telegram channel also bearing the name Syria Trust for Development, hosted on the platform but lacking any formal verification. The app, promoted as an initiative personally endorsed by the first lady, sidestepped scrutiny: If her name was attached, few questioned its legitimacy, or the financial promises it lured them with. The STFD-686 app operated with disarming simplicity. It offered the promise of financial aid, requiring only that the victim fill out a few personal details. It asked innocent questions: “What kind of assistance are you expecting?” and “Tell us more about your financial situation.” The expected answer was clear: financial help. In return, users would supposedly receive monthly cash transfers of around 400,000 Syrian pounds — roughly $40 at the time — sent anonymously via local money transfer companies. Sending small sums across Syria, whether under real or fictitious names, required nothing more than a phone number, and the black market was teeming with intermediaries ready to facilitate such transfers. On the surface, the app appeared to offer a special service for officers. Its first disguise was a humanitarian one: claiming to support the “heroes of the Syrian Arab Army” through a new initiative, while showcasing photos of real activities from the official Syria Trust for Development website. The second mask was emotional, employing reverent language that praised the soldiers’ sacrifices: “They give their lives so that Syria may live with pride and dignity.” The third was nationalistic, and framed the app as a “patriotic initiative” designed to bolster loyalty, and this mask proved the most persuasive. The fourth mask was visual: The app’s name, both in English and Arabic, mirrored the official organization exactly. Even the logo was an identical replica of Syria Trust’s emblem. Once downloaded, the app opened a simple web interface embedded within the application, which redirected users to external websites that didn’t display in the app bar. The sites, syr1.store and syr1.online, mimicked the official domain of Syria Trust (syriatrust.sy). The use of “syr1,” an abbreviation of Syria, in the domain name seemed plausible enough, and few users paid much mind. In this case, no special attention was given to the URL; it was simply assumed to be trustworthy. To access the questionnaire, users were asked to submit a series of seemingly innocent details: full name, wife’s name, number of children, place and date of birth. But the questions quickly escalated into riskier territory: the user’s phone number, military rank and exact service location down to the corps, division, brigade and battalion. Determining officers’ ranks made it possible for the app’s operators to identify those in sensitive positions, such as battalion commanders and communications officers, while knowing their exact place of service allowed for the construction of live maps of force deployments. It gave the operators behind the app and the website the ability to chart both strongholds and gaps in the Syrian army’s defensive lines. The most crucial point was the combination of the two pieces of information: Disclosing that “officer X” was stationed at “location Y” was tantamount to handing the enemy the army’s entire operating manual, especially on fluid fronts like those in Idlib and Sweida. According to an analysis by a Syrian software engineer, what the officers dismissed as a tedious questionnaire was, in reality, a data entry form for military algorithms, turning their phones into live printers that generated highly accurate battlefield maps. “The majority of officers often ignored security protocols,” the engineer said. “I doubt any of them realized that behind these innocent-looking forms, traps were laid for them with the innocence of a wolf.” He added that while the mechanism of espionage was technically old, it remained devastatingly effective, especially given the widespread ignorance of cyberwarfare within the Syrian army. At the bottom of the application’s web page, another trap lay in wait: an embedded Facebook contact link. This time, the user’s social media credentials were siphoned directly to a remote server, quietly stealing access to personal accounts. If the victim somehow escaped the first snare, there was a good chance they would fall into the second. After harvesting basic information through embedded phishing links, the attack moved to its second stage: deploying SpyMax, one of the most popular Android surveillance tools. SpyMax is an advanced version of SpyNote, notorious on the black market, and typically distributed through malicious APK files (files designed to install mobile apps on Android phones), disguised on fake download portals that appear legitimate. Crucially, SpyMax does not require root access (the highest level of access to the phone’s operating system) to function, making it dangerously easy for attackers to compromise devices. While original versions of the software sell for around $500, hacked versions are also freely available. In this case, the spyware was planted via the same Telegram channel that distributed the fake Syria Trust app and installed on officers’ phones under the guise of a legitimate application. SpyMax has all the functions of RAT (Remote Access Trojan) software, including keylogging to steal passwords and intercept text messages; data extraction of confidential files, photos and call logs; and access to the camera and microphone, allowing real-time surveillance of victims. Once connected, the victim can appear on an attacker’s dashboard, the live feed displaying everything from call logs to file transfers, depending on the functions selected. The spyware targeted Android versions as old as Lollipop — an operating system launched in 2015 — meaning a broad range of both older and newer devices were vulnerable. An examination of the permissions granted to the app showed it had access to 15 sensitive functions, the most critical among them including tracking live locations and monitoring soldiers’ movements and military positions, eavesdropping on calls, recording conversations between commanders to uncover operational plans in advance, extracting documents like maps and sensitive files from officers’ phones and camera access allowing the person who launched the spyware to, potentially, remotely broadcast footage of military facilities. Once the initial information was extracted, fake servers took over, routing data through anonymous cloud platforms to make tracing the source of the malware nearly impossible. The app was also signed with forged security certificates, much like a thief donning a fake police uniform to slip past security. The attack combined two deadly elements: psychological deception (phishing) and advanced cyberespionage (SpyMax). The evidence suggests the malware was operational and the infrastructure ready before June 2024, five months before the launch of the operation that led to the Assad regime’s collapse. A review of the domains associated with Syr1.store revealed six linked domains, one of which was registered anonymously. Through SpyMax, whoever was behind the app extracted a devastating range of data from the officers’ phones, including their ranks and identities, whether they were responsible for sensitive posts and their geographical locations (possibly in real time). They would have access to troop concentrations, phone conversations, text messages, photos and maps on officers’ devices, and be able to monitor military facilities remotely. The phishing site itself collected myriad sensitive data from military personnel, including their full names, names of family members, ranks and service positions, dates and places of birth and Facebook login credentials if they used the social media contact form. The potential uses are also myriad, and would have allowed the operators to pinpoint gaps in defensive lines, which were exploited in Aleppo, as well as locating weapons depots and communication hubs, and assessing the real size and strength of deployed troops. It would have allowed those with access to the information to launch surprise attacks on exposed sites, potentially cutting off supplies to isolated military units, issue contradictory orders to troops and sow confusion among military cadres, in addition to blackmailing the officers. It’s at least clear that the Assad regime’s enemies benefited from the app in some way — although exactly how is difficult to confirm, and it is difficult to surmise who was behind it. For example, one of the domains linked to the hackers appears to be hosted in the United States, which had ties to the armed opposition, but the location of the server could have been masked as a misdirection. Israeli airstrikes in the immediate aftermath of the fall of the regime destroyed almost the entire conventional military capacity of Syria, and one Syrian army officer, who served in the air defense units of Tartous Governorate, told New Lines that the application had been active at his site. That meant that Syrian officers had already, through their own carelessness, uploaded the blueprints of Syria’s defensive fronts to a cloud server — accessible to anyone who knew where to look. But the compromised data could have also been helpful to the opposition, which carried out attacks such as a clandestine operation targeting the military joint operations room in Aleppo, which this magazine previously reported on, leading up to the broader campaign that unseated Assad. And perhaps this is what makes this spyware unique: While other spyware operations have largely targeted individuals, like the use of the application Pegasus to spy on activists in the Middle East, this particular campaign seems to have been focused on compromising an entire military institution through a primitive but devastating phishing attack. It is difficult to determine exactly how many phones were compromised in the attack, but the number is likely in the thousands. A story published on the same Telegram channel in mid-July noted that 1,500 money transfers had been sent that month, with other posts referencing additional rounds of money distribution. None of those who received money through the app agreed to speak with me, citing security concerns. Compromised military command may also help explain some of the stranger episodes that surrounded the regime’s collapse, in addition to the rapid military success of the opposition’s campaign. One example is the exchange of fire that erupted on Dec. 6, 2024, between forces loyal to two senior Syrian commanders — Maj. Gen. Saleh al-Abdullah and Maj. Gen. Suhail al-Hassan — in the Hama region’s Sibahi Square. At the time, at least 30,000 Syrian army fighters had gathered in the area. According to witnesses, al-Abdullah issued orders for a southern withdrawal, while al-Hassan commanded his forces to advance north and engage opposition units. The conflicting commands led to a firefight between the two factions that raged for more than two hours. This clash can also be explained by the likelihood that each commander had received contradictory orders, either due to direct infiltration of the command structure or because external actors were using compromised channels to issue false instructions. It remains unclear how much of the command might have been compromised. In an interview with Syria TV following the fall of the Assad regime, Ahmad al-Sharaa, Syria’s interim leader, revealed additional details about Operation Deterrence of Aggression, the name given to the campaign that ousted the former dictator. He stated that planning for the operation had spanned five years and that the Syrian regime had known about it, but failed to stop it. This, he emphasized, is a matter of certainty. How did he know? It is unlikely that any one thread that can be traced in the dramatic fall of the Syrian regime was responsible for unraveling the entirety of the system, and the story of the days leading up to the final campaign may never be fully uncovered. But the Syrian Trojan horse may point to one significant part of that story. Sign up to our mailing list to receive our stories in your inbox.",

      "content": "Cambodian and Thai officials claim soldiers from other side opening fire first in latest deadly border clash between the neighbours. Cambodia’s leader has called for calm in the country a day after a soldier was killed in a brief clash with troops from neighbouring Thailand, in a disputed zone along the Thai-Cambodia border. In a written statement on Thursday, Prime Minister Hun Manet said people should not “panic over unverified material being circulated”, and reassured the country that he did not want a conflict between Cambodian and Thai forces. “For this reason, I hope that the upcoming meeting between the Cambodian and Thai army commanders will produce positive results to preserve stability and good military communication between the two countries, as we have done in the past,” said Hun Manet, who is currently on a visit to Tokyo. “Even though I am in Japan … the command system and hierarchy for major military operations such as troop movements remain under my full responsibility as prime minister,” he added. Cambodia’s Ministry of National Defence said on Wednesday that one of its soldiers was killed in a brief firefight with Thai troops, in a disputed border region between the country’s Preah Vihear province and Thailand’s Ubon Ratchathani province. The ministry accused Thai soldiers of opening fire first on a Cambodian military post that had long existed in the contested border zone. However, Thailand’s Minister of Defence Phumtham Wechayachai said Cambodian forces in the area had opened fire first, adding they had previously dug a trench in the area in an effort to assert Cambodia’s claim over the disputed territory, local media reported. Advertisement “I have been informed that the return fire was necessary to defend ourselves and protect Thailand’s sovereignty. I have instructed caution. Although the ceasefire holds, both sides continue to face each other,” the minister said, according to Thailand’s The Nation newspaper. The Nation also reported that Thailand’s Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra spoke with her counterpart, Hun Manet, and both were working to lower the temperature on the dispute. “We don’t want this to escalate,” the Thai prime minister was quoted as saying. Cambodia and Thailand have a long history of disputes along their mutual border, including armed clashes that broke out in 2008 near Cambodia’s Preah Vihear Temple, which was listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site that year. Fighting also broke out along the border in 2011. The Associated Press news agency reports that in February, Cambodian troops and their family members entered an ancient temple along the border and sang the Cambodian national anthem, leading to a brief argument with Thai troops. The incident was recorded on video and went viral on social media.",

      "content": "15 Years Ago I Was on a Gaza Flotilla Mission That Ended in the Deaths of 10 and Wounding of 50 by Israeli Commandos How Violent Will They Be When the Flotilla Sails Again for Gaza Fifteen years ago, in May 2010, I was one of approximately 700 persons that sailed on 7 unarmed civilian ships to break the Israeli naval blockade of Gaza and bring needed food, medicines and materials to Palestinians in Gaza who were suffering under the brutal, inhumane policies enacted by the Israeli government, which included a naval, land and air blockade of Gaza. These policies included “putting Palestinians on a diet” by reducing the caloric intake of persons living in Gaza by allowing a much reduce number of trucks carrying food into Gaza. Hard to Predict/Believe the Cruelty of the State of Israel Toward Palestinians I don’t think 15 years ago, we could have predicted the cruelty of the Israeli government as it now conducts the genocide of Palestinians in Gaza and the ethnic cleansing of Palestinians living in the West Bank. We could not have predicted that the international community would allow the Israeli government to bomb Gaza every day for over 19 months causing over 55,000 deaths, tens of thousands dead under the rubble, hundreds of thousands injured and wounded either physically or psychologically, and the entire 2.2 million Palestinians in Gaza having to move over and over again as the Israelis bombed Gaza from North to South, from East to West. We could not have predicted that even after the genocide became apparent to everyone including those making money from weapons and/or funds for political campaigns, that the United States, Germany and other Western European countries would continue to supply bombs and other military killing munitions to the Israeli government. Nor could we have predicted that the international community would allow Israel to cut off all food, medicines, water for over 90 days after the brutal bombing of 17 months. Citizens Telling Our Governments to STOP its Support for Israel Through Support for the Flotillas Since 2008, 35 unarmed, civilian ships filled with hundreds of activists from around the world have attempted to break the illegal Israeli naval blockade of Gaza. In 2008, five small ships actually got into Gaza, the first ships from international waters that had arrived in Gaza in over 40 years. Since December 2008 with the 27-day Israeli attack on the people of Gaza called “Operation Cast Lead,” no ships have gotten into Gaza. Yet we keep sending ships with brave people willing to stand up to Israel and symbolic cargo to end the naval blockade of Gaza. Israeli Military Increasingly Violent toward Unarmed Civilian Ships-Including BOMBING ships! Crew and participants on each of the ships that have attempted to break the Israeli naval blockade of Gaza has been met with some level of violence. After 10 Turkish citizens (including one Turkish American young man) were killed and 50 Turkish citizens wounded on fifteen years ago on May 31, 2010, on the large Mavi Marmara ship, crew and participants on other ships have been beaten up, tasered and mistreated on the subsequent ships. On May 2, 2025, Israeli commandos bombed a Gaza Freedom Flotilla ship called the “Conscience,” so named to remind every person in the world that each is a part of the conscience of the world and they should be doing everything within their power to stop the Israeli genocide, and their government’s complicity. The May 2, 2025 bombing came directly after an Israeli C-130 aircraft was flown from Israel and circled the European island nation of Malta. The Conscience was anchored in international waters 13 kilometers off Malta. The Conscience was hit by two explosive devices fired from drones. Crew members report hearing drones around the ship prior to the explosives hitting and seriously damaging the ship. Several of the 13 crew members and 6 non-crew participants were injured by shrapnel and broken glass caused by the explosives. Organizers of the Gaza flotilla had planned for 32 participants to join onboard the Conscience later in the morning of May 2. Had the explosive detonated on the ship six hours later, many others could have been injured. Israel Directs the U.S. to Order Palau to Cancel the Flag and Certification of the Conscience We know there was much international complicity in the bombing of the Conscience. About 12 hours before the bombing, the small Pacific island nation of Palau, which will receive $890 million from the United States over the next 20 years through the Compact of Free Association, cancelled the flag and certification of the Conscience, giving no reason. The annual income of Palau citizens is $17,000. I understand that the classified cables will be available soon from the US Embassy in Tel Aviv, Israel requesting that at the direction of the State of Israel that the US State Department and White House direct Palau to cancel the flag of the Conscience. Additionally, the agency we had hired to conduct the transfer of participants from shore to the Conscience reported that they had never received any interest from Maltese government officials on the transfer of persons to ships until the day before the attack on Sunday, May 1, a national holiday in Malta, when the agency was deluged with calls from Maltese officials informing them that the flag and certification of the Conscience had been cancelled…on a Sunday…without explanation of the reason for the cancellation. The US Embassy in Malta no doubt informed the Maltese government of Palau’s cancellation of the flag as soon as it was cancelled at the direction of the US government. Despite the Possible Israeli Violence toward flotilla ship, another Gaza flotilla ship “Madleen” will sail over the May 31-June 1, 2025 weekend As organizers of the flotilla, we recognize that Israel has dramatically increased its killing of Palestinians and with the bombing of the Conscience has issued another warning to the worldwide community that if you challenge Israeli policies they will bomb you and the nations from where you come will not care…as they don’t care how many Palestinians Israel has killed. But despite this warning on May 2, we have many people who are willing to put their lives on the line in hope that their action will spur worldwide condemnation and isolation of Israel and force them to stop the genocide. Our participants know that the Israeli navy has already made plans on how the Madleen will be stopped. The history of the Gaza flotilla shows that Israel will shoot from helicopters unarmed civilians standing on the top deck of our ship (Mavi Marmara). We know Israel will board our ships and beat up and taser Captains, crew and participants. (Marianne, Estelle, Al Awda, Freedom) And now we know that Israel will bomb our ships. (Conscience) What’s Next from the Israeli Navy? Nonviolent Stopping of Ships? NO ! Despite having nonviolent means available to stop ships of the flotilla, such as damaging the propeller (which they did to two ships in 2011), or blocking the forward movement of our ships by putting their ships in front of ours and bringing the ship to a halt and waiting until our ship has to return to a port for water or food, or asking NATO ships to stop our ship (and hopefully NATO would take into account international maritime law which Israel does not)… we are well aware that violence is the Israeli approach to anyone and any vessel challenging their genocide of Palestinians in Gaza. Would Israel on Steroids Use Torpedoes Against an Unarmed, Civilian Ship Filled with Activists Challenging a Genocide? We have no doubts the Israeli military may use other weapons against the flotilla, including torpedoes from submarines. The “order of battle,” or units/equipment used by the Israeli navy in stopping ships from the flotilla has included all classes of naval vessels form large warships, to small boarding boats to submarines, from surveillance aircraft, to drones, to helicopters. We do not put out of the range of possibilities that the Israeli navy, that has been firing naval artillery guns from their ships into Gaza, might want to give their submarine crews an opportunity to participate in the killings by the Israeli government of Palestinians and activists from around the world. According to Naval News, Israel’s latest submarine, INS Drakon (‘Dragon’), was launched in Kiel, Germany in 2023 and it shows a significant growth in Israeli submarine capabilities. It has a unique design with a large “sail,” which could be used for autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs), uncrewed air vehicles (UAVs), loitering munitions such as drones (which may have been used in the attack on the Conscience ship, or even a rescue submersible, as well as for launching a missile. Join the Departure for the Gaza Flotilla ship “Madleen” in Catania, Sicily May 30, 31st and June 1, 2025 You may think we are crazy, but we have made public the departure of the next wave of the Gaza flotilla sailing to break the illegal Israeli naval blockade of Gaza… in the hope that greater publicity about the mission of the ship might provide some measure of protection…or at least knowledge that the ship is sailing and outrage if anything happens to it. If you are near Sicily, please join us for the events around the departure of the ship “Madleen” over the weekend of May 30, 31 and June 1. in Porto di San Giovanni li Cuti, just outside of Catania, for solidarity with the Palestinian people in a series of panels, cultural programs, and community gatherings.

      "content": "India and Pakistan have shifted from armed confrontation to a diplomatic offensive, seeking to shape global opinion. Islamabad, Pakistan – Pakistan Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif visited Azerbaijan in February, and Turkiye only a month ago, in April. Yet, this week, he was back in both countries, as part of a five-day, four-nation diplomatic blitzkrieg also including stops in Iran and Tajikistan, where Sharif will hold talks on Thursday and Friday. And he isn’t alone: Sharif is being accompanied by Army Chief Asim Munir – recently promoted to Pakistan’s only second-ever field marshal – and Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar. Their destinations might be familiar, but the context has changed dramatically since Sharif’s previous visits. More than two weeks after a four-day standoff between Pakistan and India – during which they exchanged missile and drone attacks – diplomacy has become the new battlefront between the South Asian neighbours. India has launched a global diplomatic campaign, sending delegations to more than 30 countries, accusing Pakistan of supporting “terrorist groups” responsible for attacks in India and Indian-administered Kashmir. “We want to exhort the world to hold those responsible for cross-border terrorism accountable, those who have practiced this for 40 years against India, that is Pakistan. Their actions need to be called out,” said Randhir Jaiswal, spokesperson for India’s Ministry of External Affairs, last week. On April 22, gunmen killed 26 people, most of them tourists, in Pahalgam, a hill resort in Indian-administered Kashmir, in the worst such attack on civilians in years. India blamed the killings on The Resistance Front (TRF), which it alleges is linked to Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT), a Pakistan-based group designated as a “terrorist” entity by the United Nations. New Delhi accused Islamabad of complicity in the attacks. Advertisement Pakistan denied the allegations, calling for a “transparent, credible, independent” investigation. Then, on May 7, India launched a series of missiles aimed at what it said was “terrorist infrastructure” in parts of Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir. Islamabad insisted that the missiles struck civilians, mosques and schools. More than 50 people, including at least 11 security personnel, were killed in the Indian missile attacks. This was followed by drone incursions and, on May 10, both sides fired missiles at each other’s military bases, as they stood on the brink of a full-fledged war before they agreed to a ceasefire that the United States says it brokered. Now, Pakistan, say officials and analysts, is looking to flip India’s narrative before the world – projecting itself as an advocate of peace and stability in South Asia, and New Delhi as the aggressor looking to stoke tensions. ‘We want peace’ On Wednesday, Sharif expressed willingness to engage in dialogue with India on “all matters” if India reciprocates “in all sincerity”. Speaking at a trilateral summit in Lachin, Azerbaijan, Sharif said trade could resume if India cooperated on all issues, including “counterterrorism”. “I have said in all humility that we want peace in the region, and that requires talks on the table on issues which need urgent attention and amicable resolution, that is the issue of Kashmir, according to the resolutions of the United Nations and the Security Council, and as per the aspirations of the people of Kashmir,” he said. Kashmir, a picturesque valley in the northeastern subcontinent, remains the root of conflict between the two nuclear-armed nations since their independence in 1947. A 1948 UN resolution called for a plebiscite to determine Kashmir’s future, but eight decades later, it has yet to take place. India and Pakistan each administer parts of Kashmir, while China controls two small regions. India claims the entire territory; Pakistan claims the portion administered by India, but not the areas held by Pakistan’s ally, China. Contrasting diplomacy But there are other motivations driving Pakistan’s diplomatic outreach, say officials and experts. India’s diplomatic delegations that are currently touring the world include members from various political parties, including the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the opposition Indian National Congress (INC), projecting a unified stance. In contrast, Pakistan’s current mission is led by top state officials, including Sharif and army chief Munir, widely considered the most powerful figure in the country. The trip also reflects strategic alignment, say analysts. Turkiye, whose drones were used by Pakistan in the recent conflict, is a key defence partner. Advertisement “Pakistan’s defence cooperation with Turkey is especially deep,” said Christopher Clary, assistant professor of political science at the University at Albany. “Evidence suggests several Turkish-origin systems were used in this recent clash, with varying levels of effectiveness, so there is much to talk about between the two,” he told Al Jazeera. Khurram Dastgir Khan, a former federal minister for foreign affairs and defence, is part of a Pakistani delegation set to visit the US, United Kingdom and European Union headquarters in Brussels next month. He said the current trip by Sharif, Munir and Dar is at least partly about highlighting Pakistan’s capacity to wage a modern war against a larger adversary. “There is immense interest in how Pakistan fought the recent war,” Khan said. “There are countries deeply interested in learning the details, what capabilities Pakistan used and what Indians had,” he added. “This opens new strategic possibilities for Pakistan’s defence forces to provide training to others. We are battle-tested. This makes us highly sought after, not just in the region but globally.” Pakistan relied heavily on Chinese-supplied weaponry, including the fighter jets and missiles it deployed against India, and the air defence systems it used to defend itself from Indian missiles. Post-conflict narrative battle Though both countries claimed victory after the conflict, the battle over narratives has since raged across social media and public forums. Pakistan claims to have downed six Indian jets, a claim neither confirmed nor denied by India, while Indian missiles penetrated deep into Pakistani territory, revealing vulnerabilities in Pakistan’s air defences. India has also suspended the six-decade-old Indus Waters Treaty (IWT), a critical water-sharing agreement that is vital to Pakistan. Recently, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi urged Pakistanis to reject “terrorism”. “Live a life of peace, eat your bread or choose my bullet,” Modi said, during a speech in India’s Gujarat state. He also criticised the IWT as “badly negotiated”, claiming it disadvantaged India. Muhammad Shoaib, an academic and security analyst at Quaid-i-Azam University, said Modi’s remarks reflected “ultra-nationalism” and were targeted at a domestic audience. “The Indian diplomatic teams won’t likely focus on what Pakistan says. They will only implicate Pakistan for terrorism and build their case. Meanwhile, the Pakistani delegation will likely use Modi’s statements and international law regarding the IWT to bolster their arguments,” he told Al Jazeera. Khan, who is also a senior member of the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PMLN), the governing party which premier Sharif belongs to, said the upcoming diplomatic mission that he will be part of will focus on issues like India’s suspension of the IWT. Advertisement “Our fundamental point is that Pakistan seeks to maintain lasting peace in South Asia, but three major hurdles are posed by Indian aggression,” he said. The first, according to Khan, is “Indian-sponsored terrorism” in Pakistan, in which, he claimed, more than 20 people have been killed over the past four years. India has been accused by the US and Canada of transnational assassinations. In January 2024, Pakistan also accused India of carrying out killings on its soil. India denies involvement. Pakistan also accuses India of backing separatist groups in its Balochistan province – again, an allegation that India rejects. “The second point is India’s utterly irresponsible suspension of the IWT,” Khan said. “Pakistan has rightly said that any step by India to stop our water will be treated as an act of war. This is something that can bring all the region in conflict and I believe that if India acquires capability to divert waters in next six to 10 years, and tries to do so, it will lead to a war,” Khan warned. The third issue, Khan said, is Pakistan’s concern over India’s “status as a responsible nuclear power”. In the past, New Delhi has frequently cited the nuclear proliferation facilitated by Abdul Qadeer Khan, the father of Pakistan’s nuclear programme, as evidence that Islamabad cannot be trusted with the safe management of its nuclear weapons. But in recent days, India’s internal security minister, Amit Shah – widely viewed as the country’s second-most powerful leader after Modi – has confirmed that India used its homegrown BrahMos missile against Pakistan during the recent military escalation. The BrahMos, developed with Russia, is a supersonic cruise missile capable of Mach 3 – three times the speed of sound – and a range of 300 to 500km (200 to 300 miles). It can carry both conventional and nuclear warheads and be launched from land, air, or sea. Khan, who served as defence minister from 2017 to 2018, warned of “unimaginable consequences” from using such weapons. “Once the missile is in the air, you cannot know what payload it carries until it hits the target. This is very, very irresponsible,” he said. “India has already shown recklessness when it mistakenly fired a missile into our territory a few years ago.” Khan was referring to an incident in March 2022, when India fired a BrahMos “accidentally” into Pakistani territory, where it fell in the densely populated city of Mian Channu, roughly 500km (300 miles) south of capital Islamabad. India at the time acknowledged that accidental launch was due to a “technical malfunction” and later sacked three air force officials. Ceasefire holds, but tensions linger While the conflict brought both countries to the edge of war, the ceasefire declared on May 10 has held, with troops gradually returning to peacetime positions. Shoaib, also a research fellow at George Mason University in the US, expressed cautious optimism. “Initiating hostilities is risky. No side wants to be seen as irresponsible. For that to break, it would take a major incident,” he said. Tughral Yamin, a former military officer and researcher in Islamabad, noted that while diplomacy offers no guarantees, the ceasefire could last. “India has seen that Pakistan is no cakewalk. It has both conventional and nuclear deterrence,” he told Al Jazeera. “Both sides will remain alert, and Pakistan must address weaknesses exposed in the standoff.” Advertisement Clary added that while the India-Pakistan relationship remains fragile, history suggests that intense clashes are often followed by calmer periods. “It is reasonable for both countries and international observers to hope for the best but prepare for the worst over the next few months,” he said. But Khan, the former minister, questioned Modi’s comments after the military crisis, where the Indian PM said any attack on the country’s soil would now be seen as worthy of a military response, and that New Delhi would cease to draw any distinction between Pakistan’s military and non-state armed groups. “The new stated policy of the Indian government is to attack Pakistan even after minor incidents, without waiting for evidence. This puts the entire region on edge,” he said. “This trigger-happy policy should concern not just Pakistan, but the entire world.”",

      "content": "Trump administration has relied on a sweeping view of executive power to push for the deportation of pro-Palestine students. A United States federal judge has said that an effort by the administration of President Donald Trump to deport pro-Palestine student activist Mahmoud Khalil is likely unconstitutional. District Judge Michael Farbiarz of New Jersey wrote on Wednesday that the government’s claim that Khalil constituted a threat to US national security and foreign policy was not likely to succeed. “Would an ordinary person have a sense that he could be removed from the United States because he ‘compromise[d]’ American ‘foreign policy interests’ — that is, because he compromised US relations with other countries — when the Secretary has not determined that his actions impacted US relations with a foreign country?” Farbiarz wrote. “Probably not.” Farbiarz did not immediately rule on the question of whether Khalil’s First Amendment rights to free speech were violated. He also did not order Khalil’s immediate release, citing unanswered questions about his permanent residency application. The judge is expected to order further steps in the coming days. A ruling against the government would be the latest legal setback for the Trump administration’s controversial efforts to crack down on pro-Palestine activism across the US in the name of national security and combating anti-Semitism. But critics have accused the Trump administration of violating basic constitutional rights in its efforts to do so. Khalil, a lawful permanent resident of the US, was the first high-profile arrest made in the Trump administration’s push to expel student protesters involved in demonstrations against Israel’s war in Gaza. Advertisement A former graduate student, Khalil had served as a spokesperson for the antiwar protests at Columbia University. But on March 8, the 30-year-old was arrested in the hall of his student housing building in New York City, while his wife, Dr Noor Abdalla, filmed the incident. He was then transferred from a detention centre in New Jersey to one in Jena, Louisiana, while his lawyers struggled to ascertain his location. He remains imprisoned in the Jena facility while the US government seeks his deportation. In public statements, Khalil has said that his detention is part of an effort to chill dissent over US support for Israel’s war, which has been described as a genocide by human rights groups and United Nations experts. Civil liberties organisations have also expressed alarm that Khalil’s detention appears premised on his political views, rather than any criminal acts. Khalil has not been charged with any crime. In Louisiana, Khalil continues to face an immigration court weighing his deportation. But in a separate case before the US federal court in Newark, New Jersey, Khalil’s lawyers are arguing a habeas corpus petition: in other words, a case that argues their client has been unlawfully detained. US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, acting on behalf of the Trump administration, has cited the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 as the legal basis for Khalil’s detention. That Cold War-era law stipulates that the secretary of state can deport a foreign national if that person is deemed to pose “potentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences”. But that law has been rarely used and raises concerns about conflicts with the First Amendment of the US Constitution, which guarantees the right to free speech regardless of citizenship. Judge Farbiarz appeared to echo that concern, warning that the Trump administration’s rationale appeared to meet the standards for “constitutional vagueness”. That, in turn, means Khalil’s petition is “likely to succeed on the merits of his claim” that the government’s actions were unconstitutional, the judge wrote on Wednesday. Khalil’s legal team applauded the judge’s order, writing in a statement afterwards, “The district court held what we already knew: Secretary Rubio’s weaponization of immigration law to punish Mahmoud and others like him is likely unconstitutional.” Khalil is one of several high-profile students whose cases have tested the constitutional bounds of the Trump administration’s actions. Other international students detained for their involvement in pro-Palestine politics, such as Tufts University student Rumeysa Ozturk and Columbia University student Mohsen Mahdawi, have been released from detention after legal challenges. Advertisement But Khalil remains in detention. The government denied a request for Khalil’s temporary release that would have allowed him to witness the birth of his son in April. It also sought to prevent him from holding his newborn son during visitation sessions at a Louisiana detention centre. “I am furious at the cruelty and inhumanity of this system that dares to call itself just,” Abdalla, Khalil’s wife, said in a statement. She noted that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) had denied the family “this most basic human right” after she flew more than 1,000 miles to visit him in Louisiana with their newborn son. A judge blocked those efforts by ICE last week, allowing Khalil to hold his son for the first time more than one month after he was born.",

      "content": "Sexual violence is a \"near-constant risk\" for women and girls in Sudan's western region of Darfur, Doctors without Borders (MSF) warned on Wednesday, calling for urgent action to protect civilians and provide support to survivors. Since war began in April 2023 between Sudan's regular army and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces, the reported attacks in Darfur have been \"heinous and cruel, often involving multiple perpetrators,\" according to MSF emergency coordinator Claire San Filippo. The conflict has killed tens of thousands, displaced 13 million and left the country's already fragile infrastructure in ruins. The RSF has been accused since the start of the war of systematic sexual violence across the country. \"Women and girls do not feel safe anywhere,\" said San Filippo, after MSF teams from Darfur and neighbouring Chad gathered harrowing accounts of victims. \"They are attacked in their own homes, when fleeing violence, getting food, collecting firewood, working in the fields. They tell us they feel trapped,\" she added. Between January 2024 and March 2025, MSF said it had treated 659 survivors of violence in South Darfur, 94 percent of them women and girls. More than half were assaulted by armed actors, and nearly a third were minors, with some victims as young as five. In Tawila, a small town about 60 kilometres (40 miles) to the west from North Darfur's besieged capital of El-Fasher, 48 survivors of sexual violence were treated at the local hospital between January and early May. Most arrived after fleeing an RSF attack on the Zamzam displacement camp that killed at least 200 civilians and displaced over 400,000. In eastern Chad, which hosts over 800,000 Sudanese refugees, MSF treated 44 survivors since January 2025 - almost half of them children. A 17-year-old girl recounted being gang-raped by RSF fighters, saying: \"I wanted to lose my memory after that.\" According to Ruth Kauffman, MSF emergency medical manager, \"access to services for survivors of sexual violence is lacking and, like most humanitarian and healthcare services in Sudan, must urgently be scaled up\". \"People - mostly women and girls - who suffer sexual violence urgently need medical care, including psychological support and protection services,\" she added.",

      "content": "In late February, the IAEA released a quarterly report on Iran’s civilian nuclear program with predictable results. This weekend, the next quarterly report has dropped, and as last time, the media is in an absolute tizzy with panic about figures that should have been expected. As the AP noted, Iran has “even more near weapons-grade uranium” than it did before. Whether 60% enriched uranium is actually “near” weapons-grade, which is in excess of 90%, is hand-waved away as a technical issue. Iran has been enriching to 60% since 2021, and with US-fueled sanctions preventing them from exporting it for reprocessing, as the JCPOA was meant to allow, the number keeps increasing every time. Iran has never attempted to enrich to weapons-grade levels, and has promised to remain at 60%. Last quarter Iran had added roughly 95 kg of 60% enriched uranium to the stockpile, and with more centrifuges installed since then, this quarter they added 133.8 kg. As with last quarter’s increase, it is being presented as getting closer to having a weapon, even though Iran has not attempted to enrich any of it beyond the 60% limit and has promised not to. On top of that, Reuters is reporting that the IAEA report brought up previously discovered traces of uranium at three sites. None of this is new, but it was termed a “damning” report, and Reuters suggested it would be an opportunity for the US and the three Western European members of the JCPOA, which again the US already dishonored years ago, to declare Iran in violation of their obligations over past acts. This comes at a time when the US and Iran are negotiating a possible new nuclear deal, and potentially provides a pretext for the US to move away from the talks or make even more unreasonable demands. Earlier this week President Trump already suggested the deal would require Iran to let the US “take whatever we want” and “blow up whatever we want,” so it’s not clear how much more demands they could add. Looming over the potential deal is also the very real threat that Israel is going to unilaterally attack Iran to derail the talks. Saudi Arabia has reportedly covertly urged Iran to quickly make a deal with the US before Israel stops it with a military strike. Though the new IAEA report potentially complicates the talks right at a potentially critical moment, even this is not an unforeseen issue. The IAEA issues these reports quarterly, and the talks were seemingly scheduled in such a way that another such report would drop right in the midst of the negotiations, with the media dutifully blowing the conclusions out of proportion. Iran has suggested they want the nuclear deal to uphold Iran’s rights to a civilian nuclear program, which almost certainly is a non-starter for the US, as officials have rejected the idea of Iran being allowed to enrich uranium to any level at all, and now the demand to let the US blow up whatever they want effectively makes any program unsustainable.",

Local rail authorities in Bryansk said the derailment was caused by “illegal interference,” and Bryansk Governor Alexander Bogomaz blamed it on an explosion, saying the bridge had been “blown up.” In the Kursk Oblast, a bridge collapsed while a freight train was passing over it. Kursk’s acting governor said part of the train fell onto the road under the bridge, injuring one of the train drivers. Specialists of emergency services gather near a destroyed carriage at the scene, after a road bridge collapsed onto railway tracks, derailing an approaching train in the Bryansk region, Russia, June 1, 2025. REUTERS/Stringer Russian authorities are investigating the two incidents, and while Moscow hasn’t made any official accusations, a Russian senator blamed Ukraine. “The bridge blow-up and the passenger train derailment in the Bryansk Region show that Ukraine is governed by a group of terrorists,” said Senator Andrey Klishas. “We should respond by establishing a buffer zone, large enough to prevent any terrorist infiltration into our country further down the road. And the land that is still called Ukraine should be completely denazified and demilitarized, with the state being reset,” Klishas added. Ukraine’s intelligence services have a history of conducting sabotage attacks on infrastructure inside Russian territory. The most notable sabotage attacks were the bombings of the Kerch bridge, which connects the Russian mainland to Crimea. The Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) launched a major drone attack inside Russia on Sunday that targeted airfields deep inside Russian territory. The attack occurred ahead of a second round of talks between Russian and Ukrainian officials, which is set to be held in Istanbul on Monday.",

Most Items ‘Banned’ by Israel UNRWA said that while Israel allowed the agency to bring in some nutrition and medical supplies, as well as flour, Israeli authorities “have banned most other items, including fuel, cooking gas, shelter and hygiene products.” “They also imposed the condition that we could only deliver flour to bakeries and not directly to families. This required people to face large crowds to collect bread from a limited number of bakeries daily,” the UN agency noted. Crowds of Palestinians gathered around a bakery in Nuseirat after flour entered Gaza for the first time in nearly 3 months of total blockade.

Netanyahu Denies Starvation On Tuesday, at least three Palestinians were killed and 46 wounded after the Israeli military opened fire on crowds who overran an aid point run by the US-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF). Despite the incident, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu denied that Palestinians in Gaza are starving. Netanyahu reportedly said the Israeli army took photos of thousands of Palestinian prisoners from Gaza, claiming none of them appeared “emaciated.” Over 54,000 Killed Since Israel’s reneging on the ceasefire on March 18, it has killed and wounded thousands of Palestinians throughout the Gaza Strip through a bloody and ongoing aerial bombardment. On October 7, 2023, following a Palestinian Resistance operation in southern Israel, the Israeli military launched a genocidal war against the Palestinians, killing over 54,000, wounding more than 123,000, with over 14,000 still missing.

The Israeli genocide has been largely defended, supported, and financed by Washington and a few other Western powers. (PC, Anadolu)",

      "content": "Updated 5/30 1:15 PM Israel continues to carry out its daily airstrikes against southern Lebanon, and continues to claim they’re killing Hezbollah figures despite evidence to the contrary. Thursday, the deadly drone strike came against the town of Nabatieh al-Fawqa. The strike hit a forest on the town’s periphery, killing one person who Israel described as a “Hezbollah terrorist” and was working on restoring some sort of Hezbollah site involved in firing on Israeli territory. That’s the official Israeli story at least, and as usual, they provided no evidence to confirm it. Mayor Zein Ali Ghandour was quick to offer a correction, however. Ghandour reported that the man killed was Mahmoud Hasan Atwi, a municipal employee, and that he was in the forest to work on a water well in the area. This is just the latest of several thousand Israeli ceasefire violations since the truce went into effect in November. Those strikes have killed over 200 people, most of whom have never been conclusively identified. The IDF though, when it comments at all on who they killed, virtually always declares the slain to be Hezbollah commander of some sort or another, and declares their very existence to be a violation of the ceasefire. A second person was reported killed Thursday in another drone strike in Kfar Kila. The identity of the slain was not clear, and Israel didn’t offer any statement. Since the ceasefire, Hezbollah has not launched a single strike on Israel. The group has handed over functionally all of its sites south of the Litani River to the Lebanese Army, and the Lebanese government reported some 80% of those sites have already been dismantled. It’s difficult to say Lebanon will ever destroy all those sites to Israeli satisfaction, however, because every time a Lebanese government bulldozer is clearing a farmer’s field, Israel declares it to be the revitalization of a Hezbollah infrastructure and attacks the bulldozer. A second Israeli drone attack was reported in Beit Lif, and injured one person. That person was not identified, but the strike involved a sound bomb instead of an explosive. In addition to the drone strikes, Israel has continued to launch raids across the border into Lebanese territory, and retains soldiers inside Lebanon occupying five military outposts within. Overnight, Israeli troops reportedly entered the area around Blida, with bulldozers in tow. This is the second time Israel launched an incursion in that general area this week alone, though last night’s raid did not appear to result in any incidents. The Israeli troops entered and were in the process of approaching a Lebanese Army post in the area. The UNIFIL peacekeeper patrol, however, met the Israeli troops before they reached the Lebanese forces, and ensured Israel withdrew. Lebanese PM Nawaf Salam has urged the US, meant to be one of the primary guarantors of the ceasefire, to pressure Israel to withdraw from Lebanese soil. Salam termed the Israeli presence a “red line.” Israeli officials have insisted they have no intention of withdrawing from Lebanon any time soon, and further claim that the US gave them the “green light” to stay. The US hasn’t confirmed that, but they have not publicly criticized Israel for the continued occupation, nor the thousands of drone strikes they’ve carried out against Lebanon.",

      "content": "Gaza is still facing widespread famine because of Israel’s deliberate starvation of the population: Israel is blocking all but a trickle of humanitarian aid from entering Gaza, the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said, with almost no ready-to-eat food entering what its spokesperson described as “the hungriest place on earth”. Spokesperson Jens Laerke said only 600 of 900 aid trucks had been authorised to get to Israel’s border with Gaza, and from there a mixture of bureaucratic and security obstacles made it all but impossible to safely carry aid into the region. “What we have been able to bring in is flour,” he told a regular news conference on Friday. “That’s not ready to eat, right? It needs to be cooked… 100% of the population of Gaza is at risk of famine.” Permitting a trickle of aid is useless when a flood is needed. Letting only a small amount in after months of total siege is obviously not providing real relief, and it isn’t intended to. The Israeli government allows some token deliveries in so that they can distract attention from their ongoing starvation crimes. They let the people they have been starving to death have a few crumbs and then congratulate themselves on their benevolence. It is a deeply cynical tactic. It is meant to reduce international pressure on Israel so that their government can continue its genocidal campaign. Finance Minister Smotrich said earlier this month that their government would permit only the “minimum necessary” into Gaza so “that the world does not stop us and accuse us of war crimes.” The distribution of even this small amount of aid has already been marred by chaos and violence. The so-called Gaza Humanitarian Foundation backed by the U.S. cannot deliver aid on the scale required by a starving population, and it isn’t meant to do that. Commenting on the shooting of hungry Palestinians, Ahmad Ibsais said, “It was the logical endpoint of a system not designed to nourish the hungry, but to control and contain them.” Read the rest of the article at Eunomia Daniel Larison is a contributing editor for Antiwar.com and maintains his own site at Eunomia.

      "content": "The US-installed government in Haiti has turned to American mercenaries, including Blackwater founder Erik Prince, to fight against armed groups that now control nearly all of Port-au-Prince. Drones operated by Prince’s firm have killed hundreds, but no high-value targets. According to the New York Times, Prince’s company has been operating drones in Haiti since March in an operation aimed at killing gang members. The Times notes the Haitian government has not announced any successful operations linked to the program. Pierre Esperance, who leads the National Human Rights Defense Network, told the Wall Street Journal that more than 300 people have been killed in drone strikes over the last three months. Additionally, Prince is ramping up for a larger operation that would see 150 mercenaries sent to Haiti this summer, and has already shipped the arms to the nation. While now called Constellis Holdings, Prince’s defense contracting firm was initially named Blackwater. The company became infamous in 2007 when some of its mercenaries opened fire on civilians in Iraq, killing 17. Prince is a long-time ally of the US president, and the mercs responsible for murdering the Iraqi civilians were ultimately pardoned by Trump during his first term. Details of the agreement between Prince and the Haitian government are unknown. While the State Department denied that it is currently paying Prince, the US continues to fund Haitian police forces and Kenyan soldiers deployed to the country to help the government reclaim control of the capital city. The current government in Port-au-Prince was installed by Washington last year after the collapse of the Ariel Henry administration. Henry was forced from power after he left Port-au-Prince to sign an agreement with the Kenyan government that allowed Nairobi to deploy its troops to Haiti. Henry was Washington’s choice to lead in Port-au-Prince after the assassination of Haitian President Jovenel Moïse in 2021. Under Henry’s rule, gangs and armed groups increasingly took control over Port-au-Prince, leading the Biden administration to back the Kenyan deployment to restore order. However, the presence of Kenyan forces has not changed the tide in Port-au-Prince, as the gangs have only grown stronger over the past year. Last month, Human Rights Watch reported that the Haitian government only controlled 10% of the capital.",

      "content": "After almost half a century, the Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK) has agreed to disband following an order given by its imprisoned leader Abdullah Ocalan. The founding of the party in 1978 by a group of left-wing Kurds in southeastern Turkey was driven by a belief that parliamentary politics in the country was cut-off to those seeking Kurdish autonomy or independence, something that appeared confirmed by the imposition of military rule two years later. The end of the PKK’s decades of armed struggle was justified by Ocalan on the grounds that the future for Kurdish politics was peaceful, but “requires the recognition of democratic politics and the legal aspect”, in apparent reference to the repeated strangling of non-violent pro-Kurdish parties in Turkey over the past 100 years. The achievements of peaceful or violent pro-Kurdish activity have been limited in recent decades - Kurdish politicians are still regularly arrested or replaced, while tentative gains in cultural and linguistic representation made since the 2000s and 2010s have been largely reversed. If the PKK follows through on its promise, the most prominent organisation fighting for Kurdish rights in Turkey will be the Peoples' Equality and Democracy Party (DEM Party). New MEE newsletter: Jerusalem Dispatch Sign up to get the latest insights and analysis on Israel-Palestine, alongside Turkey Unpacked and other MEE newsletters Like most pro-Kurdish political parties, the DEM Party is just the latest incarnation of parties that have been repeatedly forcibly shuttered by court orders over their supposed threat to the constitutional order. The DEM Party was born out of the Peoples’ Democracy Party (HDP) after it merged with the Green Left Party (YSP) in 2023 to circumvent a proposed ban. The HDP’s most prominent leaders, Selahattin Demirtas and Figen Yuksekdag, are both still in prison, along with thousands of others affiliated with the party. Despite being the third-largest party in parliament and being elected to local office across the mainly Kurdish southeast, the state has continued to replace local DEM politicians and mayors with unelected “trustees”, usually over claims of support for “terrorism” - though Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has said this would become “rare” after the PKK disbands. DEM Party representatives and members of Erdogan’s Justice and Development Party (AKP) met on Wednesday with the aim of forwarding the process. The meeting came a day after a separate meeting with the allied - and historically staunchly anti-Kurdish - Nationalist Movement Party (MHP), whose leader Devlet Bahceli last October became the public face of the current push for what he calls a “terror-free Turkey”. 'We don’t do politics for ourselves' Any discussion over a future peace process is likely to be fraught with difficulty after so many decades of conflict, with potential hurdles including the release of prisoners, constitutional reform, the deepening of regional democracy, and the recognition of cultural rights. Just last week, Mehmet Ucum, an AKP MP and Erdogan's chief legal advisor, hit out at references by the DEM Party to “political prisoners” in Turkey’s jails. 'When there is ongoing conflict and violence, politics ultimately has limitations' - Gulistan Kilic Kocyigit, DEM Party MP “There are no political prisoners in Turkey,” he wrote on X, saying the party needed to abandon its “ideological-political” views on the subject. There is also the question of what role the DEM Party can play as leaders of a broader left-wing progressive movement in Turkey and as a party that represents the interests of workers, women, environmentalists, LGBTQ campaigners and other minority groups in Turkey. Publicly, the DEM leadership expresses optimism on both fronts. Gulistan Kilic Kocyigit, an MP for the city of Kars in northeastern Turkey and deputy chair of the parliamentary DEM Party Group, is one of those involved in the discussions with both the AKP and MHP. She is no stranger to the passions the issue can inflame - during a parliamentary session last year, she was punched in the face by an AKP lawmaker during a heated discussion over the expulsion of a left-wing MP from parliament. “When there is ongoing conflict and violence, politics ultimately has limitations. This goes for all political contexts,” Kocyigit told Middle East Eye. “But if there is no longer grounds for violence and conflict, it means that we have entered a new phase, in which a solution is sought politically. And in this regard, of course, new responsibilities, new tasks, fall upon political parties, social arenas of struggle - everyone.” She added that they had no intention of treating the negotiations as a matter of trade-offs and hit back at criticisms made by some other opposition politicians that they had become too conciliatory with parties who had long been their opponents. \"We’ve never had the approach of saying, 'Let’s do this, so the AKP gives us this or we’ll take this step, so the AKP does this.' This has never been our approach,\" she said. \"We don’t do politics for ourselves, and we are not struggling for our own interests. We are fighting for the peoples of this country, the Kurdish people, and all the peoples living in this country.\" Deciding priorities Although the DEM Party is heavily associated with the Kurdish movement, it is officially a coalition of a range of parties, some representing minority groups, some left-libertarian parties and some orthodox Marxist-Leninists. The party’s co-leaders - mandated as part of its commitment to gender parity - include Tulay Hatimogullari, a linguistic rights campaigner of Arab and Alawi heritage. Turkey and the PKK: Who is Abdullah Ocalan? Read More » Apart from backing the rights of Turkey’s numerous and often forgotten minorities, including Armenians, Jews, Arabs, Alevis, Laz and Circassians, the party has staked out a strong workers’ rights position and supports LGBTQ rights. But the party, much like its predecessor the HDP, has faced accusations from the government, Turkish nationalists and even other leftists of merely being a front for the PKK. The proposed end of the PKK as an organisation has also led to speculation that the group’s cadres - currently based primarily in northern Iraq - could return to Turkey and take up positions within the DEM Party, a move that would further strengthen the perception of the party as an organisation primarily concerned with the Kurdish issue. Supporters of the DEM Party, as well as analysts, acknowledged to MEE that there had long been a tension between the party’s left wing and its pro-Kurdish wing and resolving this would be key in future. “If the DEM Party adopts a political line that, while considering the Kurdish identity, also embraces the demands of non-Kurdish voters - workers, youth, women, ecologists - it could become the nucleus of broader democratic alliances,” said Ahmet Asena, a co-spokesperson for the YSP. He said that the party’s predecessors had also supported this range of causes, but that the backdrop of the armed struggle had overshadowed efforts to focus on them, with the media always returning to the question of the PKK. Though Turkish leftists had long provided a small base of support for the DEM Party and its predecessors, the conflict with the PKK - which over the decades has caused more than 45,000 deaths according to some estimates - and the prominence of Turkish nationalist discourse tended to push secular, Alevi and centre-left voters to support the main opposition Republican People’s Party (CHP). Meanwhile, electoral support for the DEM Party remains centred in the Kurdish-majority regions. Kocyigit admitted that the Kurdish issue was currently the “top matter” in their political platform. “We have taken a stance that goes beyond day-to-day political interests, one that [focuses] on the Kurdish question, a democratic resolution, and an end to the bloodshed, and we are shaping our overall policy around this,” she explained. Nevertheless, she said the party remained true to their charter and “core principles,” adding that it was focusing on the emancipation of Kurds “in a way that will benefit all peoples of Turkey”. Imamoglu's arrest One major point of controversy for the DEM Party at the moment is how to approach the issue of Istanbul Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu. The CHP mayor, whose original election in 2019 stemmed in large part from the decision by the then-HDP not to run a candidate against him, has been in jail since March on a range of what his supporters say are trumped-up charges, including - perhaps ironically - supporting the PKK. After years of the detention and dismissal of HDP politicians over terrorism accusations, sometimes with the acquiescence of the CHP, the party of Turkey’s founder Mustafa Kemal Ataturk is now under the state’s boot heel, its representatives and functionaries imprisoned and sacked. Protesters hold Turkish flags and placards reading 'Freedom for Imamoglu' as they take part in a demonstration against the detention of the mayor of Istanbul in May 2025 (Yasin Akgul/AFP) Imamoglu’s arrest has galvanised a wide cross-section of Turkish society who see it as perhaps the final nail in the coffin of an already fragile democracy, with the imprisonment of a man polls have suggested could unseat Erdogan in a future election. But while the CHP and erstwhile allies like the Workers’ Party of Turkey (TIP) flocked to the mass street demonstrations that have regularly taken place since Imamoglu’s arrest, some saw the DEM Party’s response as rather more muted. “Leftist parties joined the initial rallies and marches with their party flags, whereas the DEM Party did not,” pointed out Ezgi Basaran, author and former editor of the centre-left Radikal newspaper. “However, DEM politicians did not hesitate to condemn the arrest and expressed support for Imamoglu.\" The initial mobilisation in support of Imamoglu took place at the same time as Erdogan and members of the DEM Party were negotiating access to Ocalan, ahead of his epochal call for the PKK to disarm. This led to accusations from some pro-CHP voices - particularly those affiliated with the right of the party, such as news outlet Sozcu and Halk TV - that the DEM Party was collaborating with Erdogan and planning to support theoretical constitutional amendments that would allow him to run for another term. Kocyigit said there was absolutely \"no truth\" to the allegations that her party had made such a trade. \"Today, the government may be approaching all these discussions with the intention of undermining its own political position to extract some political gain from it. We can’t know for sure,\" she explained. \"But we cannot reduce such a profound, historical and societal issue that has cost so much - 50,000 lives, billions of dollars in financial resources, potentially countless people displaced or exiled - to something as narrow as the re-election of President Erdogan. That’s simply not possible.\" Tensions and splits Tensions in the parliamentary movement have occasionally flared up into splits and spats, such as in 2020 when acclaimed investigative journalist and MP Ahmet Sik publicly resigned from the HDP before joining the more explicitly leftist TIP, citing a lack of intra-party democracy and the influence of “rigid and sectarian” factions in the party. Asena said that the DEM Party was now left at a crossroads - does it become “a progressive, multi-ethnic force for democracy and social justice”, or does it primarily become the voice of Turkey’s Kurds, who are largely conservative, religious and had in the past been viewed with suspicion by some secular, liberal Turks? “The ongoing conflict has heavily influenced how both the state and opposition actors position themselves - as such a disarmament scenario would deeply affect party alignments and open space for a reconfiguration of political strategies,” he explained. 'When the democratic transformation begins, everything that is problematic today will change' - Devris Cimen, former HDP European spox Vahap Coskun, a law professor at Dicle University in the Kurdish-majority city of Diyarbakir, has in the past been critical of the Kurdish movement’s alliance with the Turkish left, arguing that it effectively allowed it outside influence through its piggybacking on the much bigger Kurdish cause. He told MEE that the dissolution of the PKK and the end to armed struggle could boost the DEM Party’s position in Turkish politics - but it could also open the grounds for Kurdish politics to “diversify”. “This may put pressure on the DEM Party. Therefore, if the DEM Party can adapt to the post-arms era, it will grow, but if it cannot adapt, it will face the risk of shrinking,” he explained. The DEM Party and its predecessors have so far managed to virtually monopolise Kurdish politics in the southeast, vying with the AKP for Kurdish votes prior to the latter’s decision to launch a military operation in the region in 2015. The only other specifically pro-Kurdish party with any profile in the southeast is Huda Par, an Islamist party with links to the armed Turkish Hezbollah organisation, whose politics could not be more different from DEM Party, apart from a mutual support for the Kurdish language and cultural representation. What is needed, said Devris Cimen, former European representative of the HDP, is a fundamental change in the nature of democracy in Turkey and an end to its nationalistic, exclusionary constitution, after which, everything else can and will change. “The form of state administration will change, the parties will change, society will change, politics will change, the law will change, the political language will change, Turkey’s foreign policy will change,” he said. “If the Turkish state and Turkish society achieve the democratic transformation and change that Ocalan points to, they will also achieve prosperity and democracy. When the democratic transformation begins, everything that is problematic today will change.” A new era? Going forward, the prime goal of the DEM Party seems to be securing the eventual release of Ocalan. Watching the ongoing discussions, that would seem to be the natural direction of travel - but convincing the people of Turkey that a man commonly known in the press as a “baby killer” might be an uphill struggle. “This is not a demand for negotiations, but a necessary step for the peace and resolution process to move forward,” said Cimen. People hold a portrait of Selahattin Demirtas during a gathering of Turkish Kurds for Nowruz celebrations in March 2025 (AFP) “Ocalan is the most important actor in this process, and his freedom and his ability to work freely are a fundamental condition.” Another goal could be the release of Demirtas and Yuksekdag, as well as the masses of prisoners languishing in jails for their alleged PKK links, hundreds of whom are thought by rights groups to be sick and in need of immediate release. Unlike Ocalan, repeated rulings of the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) have declared that both Demirtas and Yuksekdag should be released. The Council of Europe already initiated infringement proceedings against Turkey in early 2022 for failing to implement ECHR rulings. Basaran said that, also unlike Ocalan, Erdogan harbours personal animosity towards Demirtas, who was able to take the AKP’s parliamentary majority from it for the first time in 2015. The election of that year took place during the previous peace process, which was to collapse just months after the vote, before a coalition could be formed. As PKK disarms, Turkey solidifies its power against Iran and Israel Read More » “During the 2013–2015 peace process, Demirtas’ famous speech where he repeated the slogan ‘We will not make you president’ directed at Erdogan is said to have triggered this animosity and contributed to Erdogan’s disillusionment with the peace process, particularly as it bolstered the Kurdish party’s standing rather than delivering votes to the AKP,” said Basaran. “It is politics that keeps him imprisoned - more precisely, he is considered a formidable politician, a disruptor to Erdogan, and is thus kept out of public view. In that sense, both Ekrem Imamoglu and Selahattin Demirtas are victims of their own brilliance.” Kocyigit and her colleagues have all these issues and others to deal with in their ongoing meetings with political leaders. Compared to previous attempts at negotiating an end to the Kurdish conflict, there appears to be relatively little vocal opposition. The MHP - who supported the shuttering of the DEM Party's predecessor party - agreed on Tuesday to the establishment of a fully authorised commission within the parliament to oversee the process. But a range of issues will remain contentious, not least discussions over the constitution and democratic reform. “We are now talking about a democratic resolution to the Kurdish issue, and about peace,\" said Kocyigit. “Certainly, we are entering a new era. Our main focus as of today is to resolve the Kurdish issue in a truly permanent way and establish sustainable peace in these lands.”",

      "content": "NUSEIRAT, Gaza Strip (AP) — Chaos erupted again Thursday as tens of thousands of desperate Palestinians in the Gaza Strip tried to collect food from distribution sites run by a new U.S.- and Israeli-backed foundation. Multiple witnesses reported a free-for-all of people grabbing aid, and they said Israeli troops opened fire to control crowds. In central Gaza, Associated Press video showed smoke bombs arching through the air around a distribution center, and gunfire was audible as an Israeli tank moved nearby. Witnesses said it was Israeli troops who fired the projectiles to clear large crowds of Palestinians after the center ran out of supplies Thursday. “I came to get a sack of flour … a sardine tin or anything,” said Mahmoud Ismael, a man on crutches from an earlier leg injury who said he walked for miles to get to the center, only to leave empty-handed. “There is no food in my house, and I can’t get food for my children,” he said. Turmoil has plagued the aid system launched this week by the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, which runs three distribution centers in the territory. Israel has slated GHF to take over food distribution in Gaza despite opposition from the United Nations and most humanitarian groups. Over the past three days, there have been reports of gunfire at GHF centers, and Gaza health officials have said at least one person has been killed and dozens wounded. The Israeli military said it has facilitated the entry of nearly 1,000 truckloads of supplies into Gaza recently and accused the U.N. of failing to distribute the goods. It claimed Hamas was responsible for the crisis by stealing aid and refusing to release the remaining hostages. The military’s spokesman, Brig. Gen. Effei Defrin, said the army will continue “to provide for the humanitarian needs of the civilian population while taking necessary steps to ensure that the aid does not reach the hands of Hamas.” A Palestinian man carries food in his T-shirt after receiving aid from the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, a U.S.-backed organization approved by Israel, in Khan Younis, southern Gaza Strip, on Thursday, May 29, 2025.

The distribution points are guarded by armed private contractors, and Israeli forces are positioned in the vicinity. On Tuesday, the Israeli military said it fired warning shots to control a crowd outside one center. Dr. Khaled Elserr, a surgeon at Nasser Hospital in the southern city of Khan Younis, told the AP he treated two people wounded at distribution centers on Thursday -- a 17-year-old girl and a man in his 20s. Both had gunshot wounds in the chest and stomach, he said, adding that other casualties had come in from the centers but that he did not have an exact number. In a statement Thursday, GHF said no shots had been fired at any of its distribution centers the past three days and there have been no casualties, saying reports of deaths “originated from Hamas.” Separately on Thursday, Israeli strikes in Gaza killed at least 34 people, according to local health officials. Israel said it would establish 22 more Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank. Most of the international community views settlements as illegal and an obstacle to resolving the decades-old conflict. Turmoil at aid distribution sites Hunger and malnutrition have mounted among Gaza’s 2.3 million Palestinians since Israel barred entry of food, fuel, medicine and other supplies nearly three months ago, allowing a trickle of aid in only the past two weeks. GHF has opened hubs in three locations – two in the far south around the city of Rafah, and the other in central Gaza near the Netzarim corridor, a strip of territory controlled by Israeli forces. The large crowds have to walk miles to reach the locations. More than a dozen Palestinians described chaos at all three Thursday. At one of the Rafah sites near the Morag Corridor, another Israeli-held strip, one man told the AP he and his cousin arrived at 5:30 a.m., and found thousands of people massed outside, waiting to be let in. When it was opened, the crowd flowed into an outdoor area ringed by barbed wire and earth berms, where pallets of food boxes had been left. Armed contractors stood on the berms watching, and beyond them Israeli troops and tanks were visible, said the 41-year-old man, who spoke on condition he be identified only by his first name, Shehada, for fear of reprisals. The crowd descended on the food boxes, and pushing and shoving got out of control, he said. Shehada said the contractors pulled back and Israeli troops shot at people’s feet. His cousin was wounded in the left foot, he said. “The gunfire was very intense,” he said. “The sand was jumping all around us.” At the other Rafah site, several people told AP of a similar scene of pallets of food boxes left on the ground for the crowds to take whatever they could with no control by staff. Mohammad Abu-Elinin, said “gangs” carried off cartloads of flour bags and multiple aid boxes. Samira Z’urob said by the time she arrived at 6.a.m, “the thieves had stolen people’s aid.” When she begged, one person gave her a bag of pasta and a can of beans. “I said, Thank God, and took it to my children,” she said. “I haven’t had flour for more than a week.” Another woman, Heba Joda, said people tore down metal fences and took wooden pallets. When the food boxes ran out, staff told people to leave, then fired sound grenades to disperse them, she said. As people fled through a nearby roundabout outside the center, Israeli troops fired gunshots, causing a panic, she said. Abu-Elinin said he saw one man wounded by shrapnel.

AP video showed crowds of people returning from the site, some with carts full of boxes and many with nothing. Aisha Na’na said all she managed to grab were some sticks to use as firewood. “We had come to get food for our children, but it was all in vain — we returned with nothing,” she said. Israel says the GHF system will replace the massive aid operation that the U.N. and other aid groups have carried out throughout the war. It says the new mechanism is necessary, accusing Hamas of siphoning off large amounts of aid. The U.N. denies that significant diversion takes place. In its statement Thursday, GHF said it has distributed more than 32,200 boxes of food since Monday. It says each box, which contains basics like sugar, lentils, pasta and rice, can make 58 meals. It said it will scale up to start operations at a fourth center and will build additional hubs in the weeks ahead. The U.N. and other aid groups have refused to participate in the mechanism, saying it violates humanitarian principles. They say it allows Israel to use food as a weapon, forcing people to move to the hubs, potentially emptying large swaths of Gaza. They also say it cannot meet the massive needs of the population. Israel has allowed in some trucks of aid for the U.N. to distribute, but the U.N. has struggled to deliver the material amid looting and Israeli military restrictions. U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric told reporters Thursday that Israeli authorities hadn’t given permission for U.N. trucks to move to the border to retrieve the arriving supplies for the previous three days. ___ Jahjouh reported from Khan Younis, Gaza Strip, El Deeb from Beirut.

      "content": "It is time to stop pretending that any American interests are served by our deployments in the Middle East. There may be nothing crasser than a politician seeking reelection. Nevertheless, President Joe Biden has set a new low. He chose to leave thousands of U.S. military personnel needlessly scattered about the Middle East under regular attack from multiple militant groups. After three Americans were killed, he flew to Wilmington, Delaware, and used the dead as props in his reelection campaign. The president, with the first lady and defense secretary in tow, attended the “transfer ceremony” at Dover Air Force Base for the remains of those who died. Placing his hand over his heart, he carefully posed for the public. By all appearances, he viewed himself as another victim, distressed by the vagaries of a dangerous world that he must tame. He told family members of those who died, along with the rest of us: “These service members embodied the very best of our nation: Unwavering in their bravery. Unflinching in their duty. Unbending in their commitment to our country – risking their own safety for the safety of their fellow Americans, and our allies and partners with whom we stand in the fight against terrorism.” He added somberly that “they risked it all.”",

      "content": "Reprinted from Yves Engler’s website. Dahlia Kurtz suffered two more blows in her bid to target critics of her genocidal Jewish supremacism. The Zionist influencer’s bid to reprimand the lawyer representing me and a senator who defended me failed. A year ago Kurtz went to the police claiming harassment because I criticized her violent, racist, social media posts. After opening, closing and then reopening the file against me a Montreal police investigator laid charges and sought to impose a condition of release restricting my ability to mention Kurtz’s name. I spent five days in jail in a successful effort to defeat that condition. On the day of my condition hearing lawyer John Philpot criticized Kurtz’s authoritarian, anti-Palestinian, politics. In response Kurtz complained to the Barreau du Québec. On Monday they rendered their decision, noting: “Without delving into the history of the matter involving you that led to this request for an inquiry, we will summarize the most relevant points. It appears that you are a plaintiff involved in Mr. Yves Gabriel Engler’s case (No. 500- 01-280416-253) before the Court of Québec, Criminal and Penal Division. Me Philpot is representing Mr. Engler in the case. “A release hearing was held on February 24, 2025. Me Philpot’s client was released under an order that includes, in particular, a condition not to contact you. Me Philpot made statements to the media that same day. For the purposes of our inquiry, we took cognizance of the information and documents that we obtained from both you and Me Philpot. We understand from the communications you sent us that you are claiming that Me Philpot indicated to the media that you are a liar and that he used your name publicly to defame you and incite harassment, hate, aggression and violence against you. You point out that, in doing so, he is going out and re-victimizing you to the media. You add that in his second statement, Me Philpot claimed that you “hate Palestinian children – amongst many other defamatory and egregious statements that incite hate and aggression towards you”. “As part of our inquiry, we carefully listened to the recordings you sent us, namely the aforementioned statements that Me Philpot made to the media. We also obtained and listened to the recording of the release hearing held on February 24, 2025. In addition, we obtained explanations from Me Philpot… “We further note that he mentioned the following in a second interview: “[W]hat they wanted Yves to do, to not to do, was to discuss this case about this woman, who many of us criticize, they don’t want to discuss it on social [inaudible] […] okay, in other words, whether she is a fascist […], she is a zionist, she is campaigning for Israel, she hates Palestinians, hates Palestiniens (sic) children […] ”. “Having listened to all of the recordings obtained, we cannot conclude that Me Philpot’s comments – how he worded them and the precise context in which he made them – would be considered disrespectful, rude or lacking in moderation, or that they could constitute derogatory comments that contravene his obligations of professional conduct in the way that you described… “Given the above, we are of the opinion that there is no evidence that Me Philpot contravened his obligations of professional conduct in any way. On the basis of the foregoing, we cannot conclude that Me John Roderick Philpot contravened the Code of Professional Conduct of Lawyers. Accordingly, we must inform you that no disciplinary complaint will be lodged against him before the Disciplinary Council of the Barreau du Québec.” In her bid to suppress freedom of expression, Kurtz also filed a complaint with the Senate ethics officer against British Columbia Senator Yuen Pau Woo who criticized my imprisonment. That frivolous complaint was also turned down with the Senate Ethics Officer determining there was no basis on which to pursue an investigation into the complaint against Woo. I expect the prosecution to ultimately drop the charges against me. They simply cannot want to embarrass themselves by having Dahlia Kurtz testify in front of a judge. Support Yves’ work. Donate Now.

      "content": "Former FBI director James Comey has provoked a First Amendment firestorm with a display of sea shells that included the sequence: “86 47.” Many supporters of President Donald Trump note that in popular culture “86” frequently is used as slang for eliminating (killing) someone. “47,” they conclude, obviously refers to Trump, the 47th president of the United States. In other words, Trump supporters charge that Comey is inciting terrorists to kill the president. Trump, himself, accused Comey of calling “for my assassination”. The Secret Service apparently took the matter seriously enough that the agency has opened an investigation. Everyone needs to take a step back and calm down. With considerable justification, critics have charged that recent administrations, especially those of George W. Bush, Barack Obama, and Joe Biden, harassed political opponents and badly damaged the First Amendment. There is little question that officials in those administrations sometimes sought to intimidate critics and chill debate in the news media and the general public. Pro-Trump figures complained loudly about such behavior at the time, and subsequent revelations have validated some of their complaints. For example, conservative activists were subjected to an unusual number of visits by law enforcement personnel, including FBI and IRS agents, for reasons that ranged from vague allegations of possible misconduct to clearly protected, albeit controversial, First Amendment activity. In November 2021, information from a whistleblower surfaced that the FBI had authorized a new “threat tag” be applied to parents and other people who confronted school officials. Authorities apparently even recorded the license plate numbers of attendees who voiced harsh criticisms of liberal policymakers at local school board meetings. The official justification was to take preemptive steps to discourage even the most embryonic manifestations of “domestic terrorism.” Evidence about the Biden administration’s attempts to harass or intimidate critics became even more extensive and alarming once Trump appointees took office and opened key files that had been concealed from the public. Tulsi Gabbard, the new Director of National Intelligence. released a classified document that contained the previous administration’s strategy for combating “disinformation” and other alleged evils. An especially worrisome passage authorized law enforcement and intelligence agencies to monitor “worrisome noncriminal conduct.” That mission raised a number of questions: Worrisome to whom? Worrisome, why, if the conduct was not illegal? What is the justification for spying on people who engage in behavior that even the government concedes is non-criminal? Such policies on the part of earlier administrations were alarming and should have encountered intense criticism and resistance across the political spectrum. Trump and his supporters had every right to be upset. However, with the new Comey incident and several other matters, the Trump administration appears to be engaging in similar conduct and abusing its power. For example, law firms that sided with the Biden administration’s position on various legal disputes are being subjected to transparent retaliation and blackmail. Smearing and harassing Comey by alleging that he is encouraging a plot to assassinate Trump fits that same unsavory pattern of political dirty tricks. It is appropriate to denounce Comey for circulating an inflammatory and entirely inappropriate message. “Joking” about “86ing” someone should be considered out-of-bounds with respect to meaningful debate on any topic. Given the context that Trump was indisputably the target of two assassination attempts during the 2024 presidential campaign makes Comey’s behavior even uglier. The television images of blood running down Trump’s face after the attack in Pennsylvania are still fresh in the minds of Americans. Even if Comey were an ordinary citizen, his attempt to extract “humor” from the idea of a presidential assassination is extremely offensive. Given that he was the head of an agency that has a long, well-deserved reputation for abusing civil liberties, Comey’s willingness to joke about another possible assassination attempt is exceptionally repulsive. Any decent person would be justified in denouncing and shunning him. However, he does not deserve to become a target of harassment and censorship. Venturing down that path would further damage America’s already weakened system of civil liberties and the rule of law. Trump’s supporters need to step away from that beckoning authoritarian abyss.

      "content": "Soldiers ride on a Pakistan Army vehicle in this undated image. — AFP/File At least 12 terrorists were neutralised by the security forces during separate operations in Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said on Thursday. Moreover, four security personnel, including a lieutenant embraced martyrdom while protecting a check post in the KP's North Waziristan district. According to a statement issued by the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), an intelligence-based operation was conducted in Loralai district, on reported presence of “Fitna al Hindustan terrorists” on May 28. (Clockwise from top left) Shaheed Lieutenant Daniyal Ismail, Shaheed Lance Naik Fiaqat Ali, Shaheed Naib Subedar Kashif Raza, and Shaheed Sepoy Muhammad Hameed. \"During the conduct of operation, own troops effectively engaged the terrorists’ location and after an intense fire exchange, four Indian-sponsored terrorists were successfully neutralised,\" read the statement. Weapons, ammunition and explosives were also recovered from the slain terrorists, the ISPR added. The killed Indian-sponsored terrorists were actively involved in numerous terrorist activities, including henious acts of terrorism on N-70 near Rarasham on August 26, 2024 and February 18, 2025, that resulted in martyrdom of 30 innocent civilians, it added. The killed Indian-sponsored terrorists were highly wanted by the law enforcement agencies, and were relentlessly pursued by the security forces. In another engagement that took place in Kech District, one more terrorist was killed, confirmed the military’s media affairs wing. “Security forces of Pakistan are determined to eliminate the menace Indian-sponsored terrorism from the country, and reaffirm the nation’s unwavering resolve to bring the perpetrators of terrorism and their facilitators to justice,” it added. In KP, seven terrorists belonging to Indian proxy “Fitna al Khwarij” — a reference to banned Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) — were killed in two separate engagements. On the night between May 28-29, Indian-sponsored terrorists attempted to attack the security forces check post in general area Shawal, North Waziristan district, the military's media wing said. \"The attempt was effectively thwarted by own troops and in ensuing fire exchange, six Indian sponsored Khwarij were sent to hell,\" read the statement. However, during intense fire exchange, Lieutenant Daniyal Ismail, 24, a brave young officer who was leading his troops from front, fought gallantly and embraced Shahadat along with his three men. The three soldiers who paid ultimate sacrifice include Naib Subedar Kashif Raza, 41, Lance Naik Fiaqat Ali, 35 and Sepoy Muhammad Hameed, 26. In another encounter that took place in Chitral district, security forces successfully neutralised one Indian-sponsored terrorist. “Such sacrifices of our brave men further strengthen our resolve,” said the ISPR. Pakistan has witnessed surge in terror incidents since Taliban rulers returned to Afghanistan in 2021, particularly in the bordering provinces of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan. However, the first quarter of 2025 saw some promising trends in the security landscape of Pakistan, with the fatalities of militants and insurgents outnumbering the cumulative losses of civilians and security forces personnel. Its key findings, issued by the Centre for Research and Security Studies (CRSS) revealed notably fewer fatal losses among civilians and security forces personnel compared to the fourth quarter (Q4) of 2024 and a nearly 13% reduction in overall violence, The News reported. Despite progress, Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan remain epicentres of violence, accounting for 98% of all fatalities, with attacks growing bolder and militant tactics evolving, including the unprecedented hijacking of the Jaffar Express. Projections warn of over 3,600 fatalities by year-end if current trends persist, potentially making 2025 one of Pakistan’s deadliest years. Individually, Balochistan suffered 35% of all fatalities in the period under review, and compared to last quarter, it recorded an alarming 15% surge in violence. The comparison disregards the surge recorded in other provinces/ regions as the number of fatalities remains very low.",

      "content": "President Trump had a simple but profound message about the Ukraine war during his campaign: “I want everybody to stop dying. They’re dying, Russians and Ukrainians. I want them to stop dying.” About two weeks into his second term in office, Russians and Ukrainians are still dying, and not just soldiers. On January 29, a Ukrainian drone killed a mother and her two-year-old child in Russia’s Belgorod Oblast. The following day, a Russian drone slammed into an apartment building in northeastern Ukraine, killing six people, who were described as three older married couples. Trump has reportedly given his envoy to the conflict, Keith Kellogg, 100 days to end the war, and a purported leaked plan drawn up by the administration would call for a ceasefire by Easter to begin talks on a lasting peace deal. But between now and then, many more Ukrainians and Russians will die. And for what? There’s nothing the US can do now to give Ukraine any real leverage over Russia. Time is on Russia’s side, and everybody knows it. Ukraine will have to make serious concessions to achieve peace, and that will be the situation now and in 100 days. There are other reasons to stop the war besides the daily casualties. The risk of escalation is still very real as Ukrainian drones are flying into Russia on a daily basis and sometimes target very sensitive infrastructure, including nuclear power plants. Contrary to what many believe, Ukraine did not build up its drone capabilities by itself. In its final days, the Biden administration decided to reveal a once-secret program that funded Ukrainian drone development to the tune of $1.5 billion. We also know that Ukrainian drone attacks on Russia are carried out using intelligence from the West. Russia has shown that it doesn’t want to take the war to NATO in the face of Western-backed attacks on its territory, and it’s even more unlikely to do so now that there is a new US administration that’s at least talking about ending the war. But rogue elements of Ukrainian intelligence or even President Zelensky himself might decide to go for one big provocation, something Russia can’t leave unanswered, as a final desperate effort to get direct NATO intervention. According to the leaked US plan to end the war, the US will direct Ukraine to lift martial law once a peace deal is reached. That means Zelensky will no longer have an excuse not to hold elections, and he is bound to lose after signing a deal that hands over a chunk of territory to the Russians. Zelensky knows his days in power are numbered and that this war will be his legacy. He will be remembered for choosing to fight a war he could have never won instead of signing a deal in the first weeks of the invasion that would have ended the dying and left Ukraine much more intact than it is today. For the sake of the Ukrainians and Russians who could die in the coming weeks and to bring the world back from the brink of World War III, Trump should get on the phone with Zelensky today and tell him it’s over.

      "content": "The Houthis, officially known as Ansar Allah, have vowed the attacks will continue until there's a ceasefire in Gaza and an end to the Israeli blockade Yemen’s Houthis fired another missile at Israel on Thursday, a day after Israeli airstrikes hit Yemen’s Sanaa International Airport. The Israeli military said that it intercepted the missile after sirens sounded across central Israel. According to Israeli media, the incident marked the fifth Yemeni missile attack on Israel within a week. The Houthis, officially known as Ansar Allah, said the missile targeted Israel’s Ben Gurion Airport. Several major airlines have suspended flights to the airport amid the repeated Houthi attacks. Houthi military spokesman Yahya Saree “The operation successfully achieved its goal, thanks to Allah, forcing millions of occupying Zionists to flee to shelters and halting air traffic at the airport,” said Houthi military spokesman Yahya Saree. Saree reiterated that the Yemeni attacks on Israel would continue until there’s a ceasefire in Gaza and an end to the Israeli blockade. Ansar Allah officials have also vowed that they won’t be deterred by Israeli airstrikes. The Israeli strikes that hit the Sanaa airport on Wednesday struck a runway and destroyed the last functioning airplane that belongs to the national Yemeni airline. The airport had just resumed limited service on May 17 after it had suspended all flights due to Israeli airstrikes on May 6 that left the facility “totally disabled.” Recent US and Israeli airstrikes on Yemeni civilian infrastructure and new US sanctions on the Houthis, who govern an area where 70% to 80% of Yemenis live, have exacerbated an already dire humanitarian crisis in the country. President Trump announced a ceasefire with the Houthis on May 6, which he framed as a victory, but the US essentially gave up on trying to stop Yemeni attacks on Israel.",

In a report, the global rights group blamed the government of President Bola Tinubu for failure to protect people in swathes of the country hit by raids by jihadists, and criminal gangs known as \"bandits\" who attack villages, killing and kidnapping residents. However, on Thursday Tinubu insisted that troops deployed in the flashpoints have succeeded in restoring order and tackling threats posed by the militant groups. Massacres also occur in central Nigeria's so-called Middle Belt where herders and farmers often clash over land access, with the attacks often taking on a religious or ethnic dimension. Amnesty's investigation showed that \"in the two years since the current government has been in power, at least 10,217 people have been killed in attacks by gunmen\". Benue state, which lies in the central region, suffered the heaviest death toll of 6,896, followed by Plateau state, where 2,630 people were killed, Amnesty said in a report released to coincide with Tinubu's first two years in office. Of the seven states Amnesty investigated, Borno -- the epicentre of jihadist violence which has raged in northeast Nigeria since 2009 -- was not included. When Tinubu came to power two years ago, he vowed that dealing with insecurity was one of the main challenges for his government. \"Instead, things have only gotten worse, as the authorities continue to fail to protect the rights to life, physical integrity, liberty and the security of tens of thousands of people across the country,\" said Isa Sanusi, director of Amnesty International Nigeria. Northern states that jihadists and other criminal groups have targeted for several years have seen an upsurge in attacks in recent months. Sanusi said the \"recent escalation of attacks by Boko Haram and other armed groups shows that the security measures implemented by President Tinubu's government are simply not working\". In his second year anniversary speech, Tinubu said Nigerian troops have \"restored order, reducing and eliminating threats to lives and livelihoods\" in violence-wracked regions\". \"With the successes achieved, farmers are back tilling the land to feed us. Highways hitherto dangerous for travellers have become safer,\" he added. His government is also facing simmering separatist tensions in the southeast.",

      "content": "Reprinted from David Henderson’s substack, I Blog To Differ. On November 20, 2024, Senator Jon Ossoff, one of the two Democratic U.S. senators from Georgia, spoke in the Senate to remind us of President Reagan’s call to Menachem Begin in 1982. In both cases, the Israeli government was taking aggressive measures against innocent people in Lebanon. Here’s the link to Ossoff’s speech and here’s the transcript of his speech. (Thanks to Eric Garris, managing editor of Antiwar.com, for painstakingly transcribing the speech from the Congressional Record.) Senator Ossoff: Mr. President, in 1982, as Israeli forces pursued the PLO deep into Lebanon, President Reagan was angered by what he viewed as excessive civilian casualties resulting from the Israeli bombardment of Beirut. Concerned by the suffering of innocent civilians and its impact on American diplomacy, not only did President Reagan personally call Israeli Prime Minister Begin and demand a halt to the bombing – and the bombing reportedly stopped within hours – but the American President then blocked the provision of cluster munitions to Israel out of concern that their use by the IDF was killing too many innocent people. President Reagan imposed conditions on the provision of U.S. arms, using leverage to influence the conduct of an ally. He took those steps to protect innocent life and to defend what he perceived to be America’s interests. And Israel, faced by President Reagan’s ultimatum, adjusted its policy to accommodate America’s demands. The United States remained Israel’s closest ally, and the world kept turning. This story is not a perfect mirror image for the agonizing situation we face today and have faced since the despicable Hamas attacks of October 7. Today, Israel faces a multifront assault by Iran and its proxies while the war in Gaza has devastated the territory’s civilian population. But I tell this story, Mr. President, to remind my colleagues that in the pursuit of America’s national interests, to use the leverage that comes with the provision of arms, as President Reagan did in 1982, is not just sometimes necessary; it is expected and appropriate. The United States is and will remain Israel’s closest ally. Our commitment to Israel’s security is ironclad. But no foreign government is simply entitled as a matter of right to American weapons with no strings attached. No foreign government, no matter how close an ally, gets everything it wants whenever it wants, to use however it wants. It is entirely appropriate for the United States to insist that foreign powers use American weapons consistent with our interests, our values, and our laws. And to insist otherwise weakens American foreign policy and undermines our ability to protect the interests of the American people. And to impose conditions on the provision of certain weapons to an ally when necessary is not a betrayal of that alliance. It is the pursuit of our national interest. Again, President Reagan understood that in 1982. So let’s apply the principle to the present moment. In November of last year, I addressed the Senate on the war in Gaza in the aftermath of the October 7 attack, affirming Israel’s right to defend itself, to wage war against and defeat its enemies. And I affirmed, as I do again today, America’s enduring support for our ally. I also urged that Israel respect American requests to reduce unnecessary civilian casualties in Gaza, to provide safe passage for food and essential medical supplies, to clearly define Israeli objectives, to present a credible plan for Gaza’s future governance, and to prevent atrocities by Israeli extremists in the West Bank. These requests of the Israeli political leadership have been made not just by me and many others in the Senate but repeatedly by the Secretary of State, the Secretary of Defense, and the President over the past year. That Israel take these reasonable and necessary steps has been and remains in America’s national interests. No one in this body or the American government has suggested that Israel lay down its arms and be overrun or that Israel does not have a right and, indeed, an obligation to defeat its enemies and defend its people. Rather, the United States has insisted that Israel’s conduct of the war respect our interests and our values – the interests and values of Israel’s closest ally. And yet, for the most part, this insistence has been ignored. The United States has been ignored, in part, because the Israeli Prime Minister is beholden to cabinet ministers, in [Finance Minister] Mr. Smotrich and [Minister of National Security] Ben-Gvir, who insist there be no deviation from policies that are gratuitously brutal, even over American objections. We should be disgusted by the spectacle of Israeli extremists running amuck in the West Bank, sometimes with the protection of Israeli security forces, shooting and maiming goat herders and olive farmers and burning and seizing their land. And the American people are rightly horrified by the lack of sufficient concern for innocent Palestinian life that has left so many children unnecessarily dead in Gaza, without limbs, or riddled with shrapnel. As I said on the floor last year, no one should be naive to the inherent risk to civilians that comes with warfare in a place like Gaza against an enemy like Hamas. Tragically, horribly, fighting terrorists in a dense urban environment makes civilian casualties inevitable. And yet the evidence that force has repeatedly been applied with reckless disregard for the innocent is too credible for us to ignore. We are talking about precious, innocent children and other innocent civilians who might otherwise be alive or without grievous wounds today. And, Mr. President, these things aren’t just horrific; they are inconsistent with America’s national security interests. Yet we seem to have forgotten that we have the power to influence our ally’s conduct and that we can do so without betraying our ally. It is often said that our efforts to influence close allies are best done in private and, where possible, done gently, and I agree. But in this case, that has not been sufficient nor have heartfelt public statements and harshly worded letters been effective. So what would President Reagan do? Judging by his actions 40 years ago, I think he would judiciously use the power that comes with our provision of weapons in order to shape Israel’s conduct. Some have taken to the floor tonight to argue that holding up two or three arms sales today would have been an abandonment of our ally, leaving Israel naked and undefended in the face of Iranian aggression. And that’s nonsense. The question on the floor today was not whether to shut off military support for Israel. The resolutions we debated accounted for less than 5 percent of American arms that will likely flow to Israel over the next 3 years, and most of the shipments debated will not even arrive until 2026 or 2027. Bipartisan American support for Israel’s nonnegotiable right to exist and to defend itself is rock solid. Had these resolutions passed, however, perhaps Israeli politicians would have received the necessary message that has so far been disregarded, which is, yes, defend yourself, yes, defeat your enemies, but have mercy for the innocent, restrain your own extremists, and respect the interests of the United States. The realization that every shipment is not simply available on an unlimited basis with no strings attached might have resulted in changes to Israeli policy that would reduce civilian suffering and support America’s regional and global interests, as he believed it would when President Reagan used American power in 1982. I remain steadfastly committed to the U.S.-Israel alliance. And I also believe we must be willing to say no, even to our closest friends, when we believe it is in America’s national interest. When Eric told me about the speech, I told him that I had read this story in Revolution, Martin Anderson’s book about Ronald Reagan’s time in the White House. I painstakingly copied the relevant paragraphs from Marty’s book. I should add something I had not noted when I read the book earlier: Marty’s telling of the story is all from Michael Deaver’s co-authored 1988 book, Behind the Scenes. Deaver, as you’ll see, is one of the two key players in the drama. Marty clearly took Deaver’s word for it, as I am doing here. Here’s the excerpt from Revolution: One morning in 1982 Michael Deaver, the deputy chief of staff, opened the door that led from his office into the Oval Office and walked in on President Reagan unannounced. Deaver was very troubled. The war in Lebanon was escalating. In June 1982 the Israelis moved across the border to attack the PLO. Soon their tanks and ships and planes were shelling and bombing the PLO strongholds in Beirut. Many people were being killed and wounded, and the casualties upset Deaver. “Mr. President, I have to leave.” The president was startled. “What do you mean?” “I can’t be part of this anymore,” replied Deaver, “the bombings, the killing of children. It’s wrong. And you’re the one person on the face of the earth right now who can stop it. All you have to do is tell Begin you want it stopped.” Reagan started at Deaver with a look, as Deaver later described it, of “My God, what have we done?” and then asked his secretary to get Menachem Begin, the prime minister of Israel, on the phone. George Shultz then joined Deaver and the president, and endorsed the idea of Reagan intervening with Israel. When the call to Israel came through, Reagan told Begin bluntly that the shelling and bombing of Beirut had to stop. Reagan’s last words were, “It has gone too far. You must stop it.” In twenty minutes [DRH note: Ossoff had said within hours; he was right] Begin called back and said it was done. The shelling and bombing was stopped. Reagan was somewhat incredulous and said, “I didn’t know I had that kind of power.” Notice something interesting. Reagan told Begin to stop. Ossoff is asking the Senate to hold up some arms sales. In a sense, Ossoff’s “ask” is more modest than Reagan’s “tell.” Copyright © 2024 by David R. Henderson.",

      "content": "Israeli forces have committed a new massacre targeting Palestinian aid seekers in the Gaza Strip, killing at least 32 people and wounding scores more, the Palestinian health ministry said on Sunday. According to eyewitnesses and local officials, Israeli troops opened fire directly on civilians gathered at two US-Israeli food distribution points in Rafah and central Gaza. At least 31 people were killed in Rafah and one in central Gaza, while over 200 were wounded, many of them critically. The health ministry accused Israel of using the new aid mechanism as a “trap for mass killings” and a tool for “the forced displacement of Gaza’s population”. It added that those killed in the “massacre” had single gunshot wounds to the head or chest, indicating clear intent to kill. New MEE newsletter: Jerusalem Dispatch Sign up to get the latest insights and analysis on Israel-Palestine, alongside Turkey Unpacked and other MEE newsletters In Rafah, thousands were instructed to queue some 500 metres from the US distribution point at the Al-Alam roundabout, local journalist Mohammed Ghareeb told Middle East Eye. As crowds approached the area, Israeli forces rained down bullets on them from every direction, eyewitnesses said. “I was standing among the crowd, but when people started rushing toward the distribution point, I couldn’t move with them because there were hundreds pushing forward,” Marwa al-Naouq told MEE. “Then a quadcopter appeared and began firing at them. After that, the Israeli army opened fire directly on the crowd, and American security forces fired tear gas canisters. “Dozens were killed and injured as people ran in every direction, trying to escape.” 'The occupation targeted hungry people as if these aid distribution centres were distributing death' - Marwan al-Hems, Palestinian doctor Marwan al-Hems, director of field hospitals in Gaza, described the scene as a “massacre and a slaughter\". “The occupation targeted hungry people as if these aid distribution centres were distributing death instead,” he told MEE. Southern Gaza hospitals were overwhelmed, with patients lining hallways and lying on floors due to a lack of beds and medical supplies, Hems said. “We tried to save as many as we could, but we lost some due to a shortage of blood,” he added. Hamas accused Israel of weaponising aid, saying the food distribution system had become part of a broader campaign of genocide. The Israeli military claimed it was “unaware of injuries caused by [Israeli army] troops”. Ambushed In both Rafah and central Gaza, eyewitnesses described the incidents as “ambushes” carried out by Israeli forces. In coordination with American security personnel working for the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), starving civilians were instructed in the early hours to go to a designated point near the Wadi Gaza Bridge, ostensibly to receive aid. Instead, they were met with direct gunfire, according to the Gaza-based Government Media Office. Many remain “trapped under continuous gunfire in the vicinity of the aid centre,” the office reported. A similar scene unfolded in Rafah, where thousands had gathered overnight to receive food. 'The Americans are lying to us... They call it a humanitarian point then kill us there' - Arafat Siyam, shooting survivor “They told us to go to this humanitarian zone to receive food - then they killed us,” Arafat Siyam, a survivor, told MEE. Siyam’s brother was killed. The two had arrived at the aid site at 11pm on Friday, hoping to bring back food for their starving children. “The Americans are lying to us. Since when have they cared about humanitarian work?” he said. “They call it a humanitarian point then kill us there.” According to the media office, Israeli forces have killed at least 49 Palestinians and injured 305 others at GHF-run distribution centres since the operation began on 27 May. GHF, a scandal-plagued US organisation backed by Israel, was launched to bypass the UN's aid infrastructure in Gaza. Senior humanitarian officials have condemned the scheme, saying Israel should stop blocking the UN-led system and allow aid to flow without obstruction. Overall, Israeli forces have killed more than 54,000 Palestinians in the Gaza Strip since October 2023, including at least 16,500 children. Additionally, over 10,000 people are missing and presumed dead, while nearly 120,000 others have been wounded.",

      "content": "This originally appeared at Consortium News. A day after Israel agreed to a ceasefire in Lebanon last week the long dormant war in Syria reignited as jihadist forces seized the city of Aleppo and advanced virtually unhindered in its quest to overthrow the Syrian government until finally meeting resistance from the Syrian Army backed up by Russia. This is the last chance for neocons in the United States to topple Syrian President Bashar al-Assad before Donald Trump, who tried to withdraw U.S. troops from Syria, resumes the presidency in 49 days. On the neocon list of ways to make the world safer for Israel, Iran originally occupied pride of place. “Real men go to Tehran!” was the muscular brag. But Prime Minister Ariel Sharon was persuaded to acquiesce in a less ambitious plan – to “do Iraq” and remove the “evil dictator” in Baghdad first. As the invaders/occupiers got bogged down in Iraq, it seemed more sensible to “do Syria” next. With the help of “friendly services,” the neocons mounted a false-flag chemical attack outside Damascus in late August 2013, blaming it on President Bashar al-Assad, whom U.S. President Barack Obama had earlier said, “had to go.” Obama had called such a chemical attack a red line but, mirabile dictu, chose to honor the U.S. Constitution by asking Congress first. Worse still for the neocons, during the first days of September, Russian President Vladimir Putin pulled Obama’s chestnuts out of the fire by persuading Syria to destroy its chemical weapons under U.N. supervision. Obama later admitted that virtually all of his advisers had wanted him to order Tomahawk cruise missiles into Syria. Morose at CNN I was lucky enough to observe, up-close and personal, the angry reaction of some of Israel’s top American supporters on Sept. 9, 2013, when the Russian-brokered deal for Syria to destroy its chemical weapons was announced. After doing an interview in Washington on CNN International, I opened the studio door and almost knocked over a small fellow named Paul Wolfowitz, President George W. Bush’s former under-secretary of defense who in 2002-2003 had helped craft the fraudulent case for invading Iraq. And there standing next to him was former Sen. Joe Lieberman, the Connecticut neocon who was a leading advocate for the Iraq War and pretty much every other potential war in the Middle East. On the tube earlier, Anderson Cooper sought counsel from Ari Fleischer, former spokesman for Bush, and David Gergen, long-time White House PR guru. Fleischer and Gergen were alternately downright furious over the Russian initiative to give peace a chance and disconsolate at seeing the prospect for U.S. military involvement in Syria disappear when we were oh so close. The atmosphere on TV and in the large room was funereal. I had happened on a wake with somberly dressed folks (no loud pastel ties this time) grieving for a recently, dearly-departed war. In his own interview, Lieberman expressed hope-against-hope that Obama would still commit troops to war without congressional authorization. I thought to myself, wow, here’s a fellow who was a senator for 24 years and almost our vice president, and he does not remember that the Founders gave Congress the sole power to declare war in Article 1, Section 8 of the Constitution. The evening of Sept. 9 was a bad one for more war and for pundits who like to joke about “giving war a chance.” Menendez: ‘I Almost Vomited’ The neocons would face another humiliation three days later when The New York Times published an op-ed by Putin, who wrote of growing trust between Russia and the U.S. and between Obama and himself, while warning against the notion that some countries are “exceptional.” Sen. Bob Menendez (D-NJ), then chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and an Israeli favorite, spoke for many Washington insiders when he said: “I was at dinner, and I almost wanted to vomit.” Menendez had just cobbled together and forced through his committee a resolution, 10-to-7, to authorize the president to strike Syria with enough force to degrade Assad’s military. Now, at Obama’s request, the resolution was being shelved. Cui Bono? That the various groups trying to overthrow al-Assad had ample incentive to get the U.S. more deeply involved in support of that effort was clear. It was also quite clear that the government of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had equally powerful incentive to get Washington more deeply engaged in yet another war in the area – then, and now. NYT reporter Judi Rudoren, writing from Jerusalem had the lead article on Sept. 6, 2013, addressing Israeli motivation in an uncommonly candid way. Her article, “Israel Backs Limited Strike Against Syria,” notes that the Israelis have argued, quietly, that the best outcome for Syria’s at the time two-and-a-half-year-old civil war, at least for the moment, was no outcome. Rudoren wrote: “For Jerusalem, the status quo, horrific as it may be from a humanitarian perspective, seems preferable to either a victory by Mr. Assad’s government and his Iranian backers or a strengthening of rebel groups, increasingly dominated by Sunni jihadis. ‘This is a playoff situation in which you need both teams to lose, but at least you don’t want one to win, we’ll settle for a tie,’ said Alon Pinkas, a former Israeli consul general in New York. ‘Let them both bleed, hemorrhage to death: that’s the strategic thinking here. As long as this lingers, there’s no real threat from Syria.’” US Arming ‘Moderate Rebels’ Instead of Tomahawks, Obama approved (or winked at) covert action to topple Assad. That did not work out very well. An investment of $500 million to train and arm “moderate rebels” yielded only “four or five still in the fight,” as then-CENTCOM commander Gen. Lloyd Austin explained to Congress on Sept. 17, 2015. In late September 2015 at the U.N., Putin told Obama that Russia is sending its forces into Syria; the two agreed to set U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry and Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov off to work out a ceasefire in Syria; they labored hard for 11 months. A ceasefire agreement was finally reached and approved personally by Obama and Putin. The following list of events beginning in the fall of 2015 is instructive in considering how the revived conflict might work out (probably minus U.S.-Russian talks), if the ongoing jihadi attack on Syrian forces continues for more than a few weeks. Does 2015 Chronology Foreshadow 2025? Sept. 28, 2015: At the U.N., Putin tells Obama that Russia will start air strikes in Syria; invites Obama to join Russia in air campaign against ISIS; Obama refuses, but tells Kerry to get together with Lavrov to “deconflict” U.S. and Russian flights over Syria, and then to work hard for a lessening of hostilities and political settlement in Syria – leading to marathon negotiations. Sept. 30, 2015: Russia starts airstrikes both against ISIS and in support of Syrian forces against rebels in Syria. Oct. 1, 2015 to Sept. 9, 2016: Kerry and Lavrov labor hard to introduce ceasefire and some kind of political settlement. Finally, a limited ceasefire is signed Sept 9, 2016 – with the explicit blessing of both Obama and Putin. Sept. 12, 2016: The limited ceasefire goes into effect; provisions include SEPARATING THE “MODERATE” REBELS FROM THE, WELL, “IMMODERATE ONES.” Kerry had earlier claimed that he had “refined” ways to accomplish the separation, but it did not happen; provisions also included safe access for relief for Aleppo. Sept. 17, 2016: U.S. Air Force bombs fixed Syrian Army positions killing between 64 and 84 Syrian army troops, with about 100 others wounded – evidence enough to convince the Russians that a renegade Pentagon was intent on scuttling the ceasefire and meaningful cooperation with Russia AND FELT FREE TO DO SO AND THEN MERELY SAY OOPS, WITH NO ONE BEING HELD ACCOUNTABLE! Sept. 26, 2016: Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov said: “My good friend John Kerry … is under fierce criticism from the U.S. military machine. Despite the fact that, as always, [they] made assurances that the U.S. commander in chief, President Barack Obama, supported him in his contacts with Russia (he confirmed that during his meeting with President Vladimir Putin), apparently the military does not really listen to the commander in chief.” Lavrov went beyond mere rhetoric. He specifically criticized Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Joseph Dunford for telling Congress that he opposed sharing intelligence with Russia, “after the agreements concluded on direct orders of Russian President Vladimir Putin and U.S. President Barack Obama stipulated that they would share intelligence… It is difficult to work with such partners…” Sept. 29, 2016: KERRY’S HUBRIS-TINGED FRUSTRATION: Apparently Assistant Secretary of State for European and Eurasian Affairs Victoria Nuland, U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Samantha Power, National Security Advisor Susan Rice, Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu, et al. had told Kerry it would be easy to “align things” in the Middle East. And so, this is how Kerry started off his remarks at an open forum arranged by The Atlantic magazine and the Aspen Institute on Sept. 29, 2016. (I was there and could hardly believe it; it made me think that some of these stuffed shirts actually believe their own rhetoric about being “indispensable.”) Kerry said: “Syria is as complicated as anything I have ever done in my public life in the sense that there are probably about six wars going on at the same time: Kurds against Kurds, Kurds against Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Iran, Sunni, Shia, everybody against ISIS, people against Assad, Al-Nusra… this is a mixed up sectarian and civil war and strategic and proxies, so it is very difficult to be able to align forces.” Ultimately, Syrian, Russian and Hezbollah forces beat back the jihadists and liberated Aleppo and other parts of the country in spite of U.S. opposition and are being called upon again now to do the same.

      "content": "Cholera outbreak is centred around the capital city, Khartoum, which has been devastated by more than two years of war. A cholera outbreak in Sudan’s Khartoum has killed at least 70 people in two days, local health authorities said. The health ministry in Khartoum state reported on Thursday 942 new infections and 25 deaths the previous day, following 1,177 cases and 45 deaths the day before. The outbreak is centred around the capital city, Khartoum, which has been devastated by more than two years of war between the Sudanese army and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF). The city lost access to water and electricity earlier this month following drone attacks blamed on the RSF. The army-backed government announced last week that it had dislodged RSF fighters from their last bases in Khartoum State, two months after retaking the heart of the capital from the paramilitaries. The city remains devastated with health and sanitation infrastructure barely functioning. According to the federal health ministry, 172 people died of cholera in the week to Tuesday – 90 percent of them in Khartoum state alone. Aid workers say the scale of the outbreak is being worsened by the near-total collapse of health services, with about 90 percent of hospitals in key war zones no longer operational. “Sudan is on the brink of a full-scale public health disaster,” said Eatizaz Yousif, Sudan country director for the International Rescue Committee. “The combination of conflict, displacement, destroyed infrastructure, and lack of clean water is fuelling the resurgence of cholera and other deadly diseases,” she told AFP. Advertisement Since August 2024, Sudan has reported more than 65,000 suspected cholera cases and at least 1,700 deaths across 12 of its 18 states. Khartoum alone has seen 7,700 cases and 185 deaths, including more than 1,000 infections in children under five. The spread of disease is expected to worsen with the upcoming rainy season, which is likely to further restrict humanitarian access. Aid groups warn that unless urgent action is taken, the death toll could soar. According to the United Nations children’s agency UNICEF, more than one million children are at risk in cholera-affected areas of Khartoum. “We are racing against time … to provide basic healthcare, clean water and good nutrition,” said Sheldon Yett, UNICEF’s representative in Sudan. “Each day, more children are exposed to this double threat of cholera and malnutrition.” The war, now in its third year, has killed tens of thousands of people, displaced 13 million and created the world’s largest displacement and hunger crisis.",

      "content": "An increasing number of Israeli officials are concerned that an international conference on a two-state solution will see large numbers of countries recognising the State of Palestine. Israeli officials are also concerned that the conference, set to be held at the UN in New York, is being organised with US tacit approval, according to Ynet. The officials told the publication that they believe the conference is a way for the US to pressure Israel into stopping its war on Gaza, which has drawn increasing international condemnation. Relations between US President Donald Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu have been fraying in recent months, with Washington entering direct negotiations with Hamas to free an Israeli-American soldier without consulting Tel Aviv. Israel's war on Gaza has seen over 54,000 killed and is increasingly being viewed as a genocide. The conference, advanced on the initiative of France and Saudi Arabia and set to be held between 17 and 20 June, will discuss the prospect of a two-state solution to the conflict. According to the UN, the conference will feature eight roundtable discussions focused on aspects of the two-state solution and aims to produce an \"action-oriented document\" under the title: \"Peaceful settlement of the question of Palestine and implementation of the two-State solution.\" UN General Assembly President Philemon Yang said that the conflict will only end \"when Israelis and Palestinians can live side by side in their own sovereign, independent States, in peace, security, and dignity\". France has been pushing European states, including the UK, the Netherlands, and Belgium, to use the conference as an opportunity to recognise a Palestinian state, according to Politico. The recognition would be a diplomatic means of shoring up international support for a two-state solution as Israel escalates its annexation of the occupied West Bank through the expansion of illegal settlements. On Tuesday, French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot said that the recognition of Palestine at the conference could help preserve the prospect of a two-state solution. Malta has already committed to recognising the State of Palestine at the summit, with Prime Minister Robert Abela saying that \"we cannot close our eyes to this human tragedy that is getting worse every day\". Earlier in May, France, Canada, and the UK issued a joint statement criticising Israel's war on Gaza and said that the three were \"committed to recognising a Palestinian State as a contribution to achieving a two-state solution\". Israel has warned that any recognition of Palestine could be met with an annexation of the occupied West Bank, a prospect that has been touted by several Israeli government ministers, including Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich.",

      "content": "London calling: Saudi cafés and restaurants find footing in UK capital LONDON: As the number of Saudi expats and visitors in London continues to grow, it’s no surprise that Saudi-owned brands are rising in popularity in the British capital. So, if you’re planning to make the big move — or just visiting — but you’re concerned about feeling homesick, don’t worry; your favorite cafés are coming with you, making your mornings abroad feel a little more like home. Somewhere Café Somewhere Café has joint Saudi-Emirati ownership. (Supplied) If you’ve visited Somewhere Café in the UAE or Saudi Arabia, then you’re already familiar with its unmatched ambiance, food, and décor. With its first UK outlet, the beloved café — which has joint Saudi-Emirati ownership — has brought its signature “home-away-from-home” experience, along with classic Middle Eastern flavors, to London’s premier department store: Harrods. “Inspired by our travels, we invite you to experience a piece of our journey. Much like finding a painting and bringing it home as a memento, Somewhere celebrates the unique from everywhere. The space is elegantly well-travelled, with an eclectic touch, showcasing Middle Eastern influences through craft and curation,” co-founder Amal AlMarri told Arab News. If you’re craving something beyond the ordinary, Somewhere Café delivers a fusion of flavors that reimagines nostalgic childhood dishes. Its most popular items include beef shawarma rice, kunafa croissant, and guacamole hummus. For lunch or dinner, you might try the crispy, golden shrimp kunafa or indulge in the rich truffle and cheese batata harra. To complement its bold menu, the café features a warm, dimly lit interior — a cozy and inviting space to relax with friends and family. Before you leave, the dessert menu — featuring a delectable farak French toast or French coffee baklava — deserves an equal amount of attention. Hijazi Corner At the helm is Chef Ayman Al-Zubaidi, who has cooked for Saudi royalty and celebrities. (Supplied) London’s first Saudi restaurant — Hijazi Corner — is a vibrant addition to the city’s dynamic culinary scene. At the helm is Chef Ayman Al-Zubaidi, who has cooked for Saudi royalty and celebrities. The inspiration behind the restaurant? His mother’s kitchen. “When any chef starts to speak about food, they talk about their mum. Her chicken kabsa is a bit oily, a bit shiny, and looks amazing — even just talking about it now makes me hungry,” Al-Zubaidi told Arab News last year. “But even if I used the exact same ingredients and followed her method, hers would still taste better.” Rooted in tradition, the menu features dishes typically found in Saudi homes — especially Jeddah’s historic Al-Balad district, where Al-Zubaidi grew up. Highlights include chicken seelag, slow-roasted lamb haneeth, and delicate, flaky samboosek. In just two years, Hijazi Corner has become one of London’s most sought-after Middle Eastern restaurants — a testament to the deep longing among Saudi expats for authentic flavors from home. Qahwah London Qahwah London serves a range of traditional desserts such as baklava, kunafa, and basbousa. (Supplied) For those pining for the traditional, rich, aromatic flavors of Arabic coffee, Qahwah London is exactly what you need, with a wide selection of authentic qahwah options, including a tangy, spiced black coffee or the café’s signature Royal Infusion — a warming blend of cinnamon, cardamom, and ginger. Feeling hungry? Qahwah London also serves a range of traditional desserts such as baklava, kunafa, and basbousa — the perfect pairing for a steaming cup of Arabic coffee. Guests can also book private gatherings for friends and family, or host intimate events like weddings or nikkah ceremonies. As part of its private offerings, the café provides a luxurious setting: rooms adorned with gold-plated coffee cups and an eye-catching assortment of traditional sweets — all designed to create a decadent group experience. Diwan Kitchen Diwan Kitchen captures a key element of Arab culinary culture: its deeply social nature. (Supplied) Diwan Kitchen is perfect for Saudis in the UK who are craving not only an authentic bite from home, but the feeling of being back in the Kingdom. It captures a key element of Arab culinary culture: its deeply social nature. “We wanted to show people what traditional Saudi dining is like” Adem Nasraddin, co-founder of the restaurant, told Arab News on the restaurant’s opening night in May. “There’s a rhythm to Saudi life. A scent, a pace, a flavor. We bottled that feeling and served it on a plate.” The menu takes diners on a journey across the Kingdom, from the Hijaz region, with its rich, tangy foul medammas — served in the center of the table with bread for sharing — to Najd, with jareesh, a hearty stew-like dish topped with fresh meat and vegetables. Half Million ½ M Café is on Oxford Street. (Supplied) Grab a coffee and a quick bite at Half Million Café on Oxford Street, then stroll over to Hyde Park for the perfect London morning. As in its original location in Saudi Arabia, Half Million in London is committed to delivering a “premium coffee experience.” Whether you’re in the mood for a classic breakfast tea or a vibrant red berry infusion, there’s something to satisfy every craving. And when the sun is out, their iced coffees offer the perfect refreshment. The menu — from cakes and sandwiches to freshly baked pastries — is completely halal. If you’re after a bold, decadent brew in a sleek, stylish setting, Half Million Café is the ideal stop. With its modern cup designs and curated aesthetic, it’s a chic addition to London’s café scene.",

On Tuesday , a letter signed by 1,300 academics was sent to the heads of the academic system in Israel, calling on higher education facilities to \"mobilise the full weight of Israeli academia to stop the Israeli war in Gaza\". \"This is a horrifying litany of war crimes and even crimes against humanity, all of our own doing,\" the letter, organised by a group naming themselves the Black Flag Action Group, reads. \"We cannot claim that we did not know.

It is human societies, not governments alone, that commit crimes against humanity,\" read the letter. \"Some do so by means of direct violence. Others do so by sanctioning the crimes and justifying them, before and after the fact, and by keeping quiet and silencing voices in the halls of learning. It is this bond of silence that allows clearly evident crimes to continue unabated without penetrating the barriers of recognition.” Top genocide scholars unanimous that Israel is committing genocide in Gaza: Dutch investigation Read More » Increasing numbers of prominent figures in Israel have begun speaking out again the army's actions in Gaza. Last week, former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert condemned his country's actions in Gaza, accusing the government of killing innocent Palestinians. In a BBC interview on Tuesday, Olmert, who served as the prime minister of Israel from 2006 to 2009, said what Israel was doing in Gaza is \"very close to a war crime\". He told the network that the “obvious appearance” of the war on Gaza is that \"thousands of innocent Palestinians are being killed, as well as many Israeli soldiers,\" adding that \"from every point of view, this is obnoxious and outrageous\". According to the latest update by the Palestinian Ministry of Health, at least 54,249 Palestinians have been killed and 123,492 wounded since the start of Israel’s war on Gaza. The Israeli army has killed at least 3,986 Palestinians and wounded 11,451 others since breaking the ceasefire agreement on 18 March. More than 180,000 Palestinians in Gaza have been displaced by the offensive. The ministry said that 67 bodies and 184 injured people arrived at Gaza hospitals in the past 24 hours.",

      "content": "This week, the Kremlin said it was finally satisfied with Washington’s position on future NATO membership for Kiev. “We have heard from Washington at various levels that NATO membership for Ukraine has been ruled out,” Russian spokesman Dmitry Peskov explained. “And of course this is something that brings us satisfaction and coincides with our position that Ukraine should not be a member of NATO and should not have prospects of integration with the North Atlantic Alliance.” Since 2008, the North Atlantic Alliance has been promising to one day add Ukraine as a member of the bloc. However, Moscow protested Kiev accession to the alliance, arguing that it would present a major national security concern for Russia. While the American President following Bush did little to make Ukraine a formal member of the bloc, each President ramped up US support for Ukraine. President Joe Biden finally pushed Russian President Vladimir Putin to invade Ukraine when he began treating Kiev as a de facto member of the military alliance in 2021. Putin made several diplomatic overtures in late 2021 and early 2022, seeking to get Washington to take NATO membership off the table for Kiev. However, the top officials in the Biden administration pretended not to understand that Ukraine joining the bloc was a major red line for Russia. This was the provocation that ultimately led Putin to order the invasion of Ukraine. As Scott Horton explains in his book Provoked: How Washington Started the New Cold War with Russia and the Catastrophe in Ukraine, it was a long-established fact in Washington that Kiev becoming a treaty ally with the US was going to lead to Russia lashing out at Ukraine. In fact, the best evidence comes from the CIA Director during the Biden Presidency, William Burns, who in 2008, was serving as an American diplomat in Russia. The following is an excerpt from Provoked. You can order your copy of today. Or sign up for Scott’s Substack to get the audiobook. ~ Kyle Anzalone ‘Nyet’ Means ‘Nyet’: The Memos In February 2008, Amb. Burns wrote a memo for Secretary of State Rice titled “Nyet Means Nyet.” In the memo, Burns wrote: During his annual review of Russia’s foreign policy January 22–23, Foreign Minister Lavrov stressed that Russia had to view continued eastward expansion of NATO, particularly to Ukraine and Georgia, as a potential military threat. While Russia might believe statements from the West that NATO was not directed against Russia, when one looked at recent military activities in NATO countries (establishment of U.S. forward operating locations, etc.) they had to be evaluated not by stated intentions but by potential. Lavrov stressed that maintaining Russia’s “sphere of influence” in the neighborhood was anachronistic, and acknowledged that the U.S. and Europe had “legitimate interests” in the region. But, he argued, while countries were free to make their own decisions about their security and which political-military structures to join, they needed to keep in mind the impact on their neighbors… During a press briefing January 22 in response to a question about Ukraine’s request for a MAP [NATO Membership Action Plan], the MFA said “a radical new expansion of NATO may bring about a serious political-military shift that will inevitably affect the security interests of Russia.” The spokesman went on to stress that Russia was bound with Ukraine by bilateral obligations set forth in the 1997 Treaty on Friendship, Cooperation and Partnership in which both parties undertook to “refrain from participation in or support of any actions capable of prejudicing the security of the other Side.” The spokesman noted that Ukraine’s “likely integration into NATO would seriously complicate the many-sided Russian-Ukrainian relations,” and that Russia would “have to take appropriate measures.” The spokesman added that “one has the impression that the present Ukrainian leadership regards rapprochement with NATO largely as an alternative to good-neighborly ties with the Russian Federation.” Ukraine and Georgia’s NATO aspirations not only touch a raw nerve in Russia, they engender serious concerns about the consequences for stability in the region. Not only does Russia perceive encirclement, and efforts to undermine Russia’s influence in the region, but it also fears unpredictable and uncontrolled consequences which would seriously affect Russian security interests. Experts tell us that Russia is particularly worried that the strong divisions in Ukraine over NATO membership, with much of the ethnic-Russian community against membership, could lead to a major split, involving violence or at worst, civil war. In that eventuality, Russia would have to decide whether to intervene; a decision Russia does not want to have to face. Dmitriy Trenin, Deputy Director of the Carnegie Moscow Center, expressed concern that Ukraine was, in the long-term, the most potentially destabilizing factor in U.S.-Russian relations, given the level of emotion and neuralgia triggered by its quest for NATO membership. The letter requesting MAP consideration had come as a “bad surprise” to Russian officials, who calculated that Ukraine’s NATO aspirations were safely on the backburner. With its public letter, the issue had been “sharpened.” Because membership remained divisive in Ukrainian domestic politics, it created an opening for Russian intervention. Trenin expressed concern that elements within the Russian establishment would be encouraged to meddle, stimulating U.S. overt encouragement of opposing political forces, and leaving the U.S. and Russia in a classic confrontational posture. With respect to Georgia, most experts said that while not as neuralgic to Russia as Ukraine, the GOR [government of Russia] viewed the situation there as too unstable to withstand the divisiveness NATO membership could cause. Aleksey Arbatov, Deputy Director of the Carnegie Moscow Center, argued that Georgia’s NATO aspirations were simply a way to solve its problems in Abkhazia and South Ossetia, and warned that Russia would be put in a difficult situation were that to ensue. The GOR has made it clear that it would have to “seriously review” its entire relationship with Ukraine and Georgia in the event of NATO inviting them to join. This could include major impacts on energy, economic, and political-military engagement, with possible repercussions throughout the region and into Central and Western Europe. Russia would also likely revisit its own relationship with the Alliance and activities in the NATO-Russia Council, and consider further actions in the arms control arena, including the possibility of complete withdrawal from the CFE and INF Treaties, and more direct threats against U.S. missile defense plans. Burns added in his personal comment at the end: Russia’s opposition to NATO membership for Ukraine and Georgia is both emotional and based on perceived strategic concerns about the impact on Russia’s interests in the region. It is also politically popular to paint the U.S. and NATO as Russia’s adversaries and to use NATO’s outreach to Ukraine and Georgia as a means of generating support from Russian nationalists. While Russian opposition to the first round of NATO enlargement in the mid-1990’s [sic] was strong, Russia now feels itself able to respond more forcefully to what it perceives as actions contrary to its national interests. WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange sacrificed his life and liberty to the darkest dungeons of the empire for years to bring us this information. In March, soon after the United States officially recognized Kosovo’s “independence” under continued EU stewardship over Russia’s strenuous objection, Burns met with Putin, telling him that the U.S. would push to offer a NATO Membership Action Plan (MAP) to Ukraine and Georgia, but that this “should not be seen as threatening.” Putin responded: No Russian leader could stand idly by in the face of steps toward NATO membership for Ukraine. That would be a hostile act toward Russia. Even President Chubais or President Kasyanov [two of Russia’s better-known liberals – Burns] would have to fight back on this issue. We would do all in our power to prevent it. If people want to limit and weaken Russia, why do they have to do it through NATO enlargement? Doesn’t your government know that Ukraine is unstable and immature politically, and NATO is a very divisive issue there? Don’t you know that Ukraine is not even a real country? Part is really East European, and part is really Russian. This would be another mistake in American diplomacy. In a personal email to Secretary Rice from April 2008, Burns advised her not to do it: I fully understand how difficult a decision to hold off on MAP will be. But it’s equally hard to overstate the strategic consequences of a premature MAP offer, especially to Ukraine. Ukrainian entry into NATO is the brightest of all redlines for the Russian elite (not just Putin). In more than two and a half years of conversations with key Russian players, from knuckle-draggers in the dark recesses of the Kremlin to Putin’s sharpest liberal critics, I have yet to find anyone who views Ukraine in NATO as anything other than a direct challenge to Russian interests. At this stage, a MAP offer would be seen not as a technical step along a long road toward membership, but as throwing down the strategic gauntlet. Today’s Russia will respond. Russian-Ukrainian relations will go into a deep freeze… It will create fertile soil for Russian meddling in Crimea and eastern Ukraine… The prospects of subsequent Russian-Georgian armed conflict would be high. If, in the end, we decided to push MAP offers for Ukraine and Georgia, you can probably stop reading here. I can conceive of no grand package that would allow the Russians to swallow this pill quietly. Burns said that though he thought Rice and Defense Secretary Gates shared at least some of his concerns, momentum was still behind a “legacy-building effort” to begin the process of bringing the two into the NATO alliance. Burns later wrote in his memoir, recalling George Kennan’s warnings against expansion in the 1990s, that he thought Kennan had spoken too soon regarding the first and even second major wave of NATO expansion under Clinton and W. Bush: It damaged prospects for future relations with Russia, but not fatally. Where we made a serious strategic mistake – and where Kennan was prescient – was in later letting inertia drive us to push for NATO membership for Ukraine and Georgia, despite Russia’s deep historical attachments to both states and even stronger protestations. That did indelible damage, and fed the appetite of a future Russian leadership for getting even… Yeltsin had gnashed his teeth over the first wave, but couldn’t do much about it. Putin offered little resistance to Baltic membership, amid all the other preoccupations of his first term. Georgia, and especially Ukraine, were different animals altogether. There could be no doubt that Putin would fight back hard against any steps in the direction of NATO membership for either state. In Washington, however, there was a kind of geopolitical and ideological inertia at work, with strong interest from Vice President Cheney and large parts of the interagency bureaucracy in a “Membership Action Plan” (MAP) for Ukraine and Georgia. Key European allies, in particular Germany and France, were dead set against offering it. They were disinclined to add to mounting friction between Moscow and the West – and unprepared to commit themselves formally and militarily to the defense of Tbilisi or Kyiv against the Russians. The Bush administration understood the objections, but still felt it could finesse the issue. But the administration was whistling past the graveyard. In 2005, while admitting that the population of Ukraine would not support joining the NATO alliance, Assistant Secretary of State for European and Eurasian Affairs Daniel Fried told Maurice Gourdault-Montagne, an adviser to French President Jacques Chirac, wisely, that there was a distinct lack of consensus for alliance membership in Ukraine. However, he added, foolishly, that a minor issue like Ukrainian public opinion was a greater impediment to the policy than the determination of the Russian president to prevent it. According to a State Department summary, Fried “dismissed prospects for Russia intervening militarily in the Ukraine, noting the capacity of the latter’s army and cautioned against exaggerating the split between Eastern and Western Ukraine.”",

      "content": "Civilization, in fact, grows more and more maudlin and hysterical; especially under democracy it tends to degenerate into a mere combat of crazes; the whole aim of practical politics is to keep the populace alarmed (and hence clamorous to be led to safety) by an endless series of hobgoblins, most of them imaginary. ― H. L. Mencken, In Defense of Women It is in Mencken’s spirit that I would size up this announcement from the U.S. Justice Department, titled “Justice Department Disrupts Covert Russian Government-Sponsored Foreign Malign Influence Operation Targeting Audiences in the United States and Elsewhere”: The Justice Department today announced the ongoing seizure of 32 internet domains used in Russian government-directed foreign malign influence campaigns colloquially referred to as “Doppelganger,” in violation of U.S. money laundering and criminal trademark laws. As alleged in an unsealed affidavit… Russian companies… operating under the direction and control of the Russian Presidential Administration… used these domains, among others, to covertly spread Russian government propaganda with the aim of reducing international support for Ukraine, bolstering pro-Russian policies and interests, and influencing voters in U.S. and foreign elections, including the U.S. 2024 Presidential Election. The release quoted FBI Director Christopher Wray: “Companies operating at the direction of the Russian government created websites to trick Americans into unwittingly consuming Russian propaganda. By seizing these websites, the FBI is making clear to the world what they are, Russian attempts to interfere in our elections and influence our society.” So once again a foreign power – usually Russia – is allegedly trying to manipulate the American people with disinformation as a presidential election is coming on. How dare the Russians do this? Political manipulation is allowed only to certain anointed Americans. It’s a position of privilege. So the government will protect us from “consuming” Russian propaganda without knowing it. We’re too stupid to check claims out for ourselves when they sound fishy – even when they come from so-called legitimate” sources. (Point of information: are Russians incapable of saying anything accurate worth hearing? Just asking.) Before we get all primed for nuclear war, let’s take a deep breath. Maybe it would help to picture a scene that may or may not have occurred in the Kremlin. Picture President Vladimir Putin (not a guy I’d ever hang with) summoning a top aide to his office. “Sergei, I have a great idea,” he might say this trusted aid. “Here’s $10 million. I want you to launder it, then have some American-looking company pass the money to big-time American internet influencers. But make sure the money goes to people who are already saying what we want them to say. No sense wasting it on people who don’t like us. Pay these friendly guys to post propaganda favorable videos.” Putin might have gone on: “What we want to do is capitalize – pardon expression, comrade – on the American sport of arguing about politics and culture. Muhahahahahaha! Yes, I know, America is severely divided over more issues than I can name. But it’s not divided nearly enough for our purposes! We can do better, da? This will help us in many ways, primarily by disillusioning Americans about Ukraine. That would be good, nyet?” After hearing Putin, Sergei might have laughed under his breath and agreed to oversee the project. Why might he have laughed? Because he might have been thinking, “Do we need to pay even a ruble on polarizing America? What a waste of money! America is doing just fine polarizing itself. They don’t need our help. And $10 million? Is he kidding? That’s a drop in the bucket compared to what Americans spend bitterly promoting their views on public issues. Is this the Putin who’s cracked up to be so foxy? Sheesh! Maybe I should be president.” According to the government’s indictment: Many of the videos published by U.S. Company-I contain commentary on events and issues in the United States, such as immigration, inflation, and other topics related to domestic and foreign policy While the views expressed in the videos are not uniform, the subject matter and content of the videos are often consistent with the Government of Russia’s interest in amplifying U.S. domestic divisions in order to weaken U.S. opposition to core Government of Russia interests, such as its ongoing war in Ukraine. [Emphasis added.] Immigration, inflation, and other topics related to domestic and foreign policy? Are we to believe that Russian officials think they need to amplify divisions in America? How much more amplified can they get? And what about the Justice Department’s acknowledgment that “the views expressed in the videos are not uniform”? What are we being asked to get upset about? J. D. Tuccille writing at Reason points out: Translated Russian documents [provided by the Justice Department] outlining a “guerilla media campaign in the United States” caution their intended audience that “in the United States there are no pro-Russian and/or pro-Putin mainstream politicians or sufficiently large numbers of influencers and voters. There is no point of justifying Russia and no one to justify it to.” [Emphasis added—SR] The campaign was meant to exploit “the high level of polarization of American society” by paying commentators to say things they were already saying. It’s not clear they got a lot of mileage from that program. That’s an understatement, I’d say. But Putin’s objective (if he was behind this) might simply have been to upset American officials and the public. Here’s a suggestion: let’s not get upset. Read the rest of Tuccille’s article for more particulars about the effectiveness of meddling and about the U.S. government’s own sorry decades-long record of manipulating other countries’ political systems. Then remember the advice about stones and glass houses. “So, take reports of Russian interference in American elections with a grain of salt,” Tuccille advises, “knowing that Putin is paying Americans to say what they already believe, and the U.S. does the same in other countries. Importantly, none of that interference prevents you from making your own decisions.” I have plenty of criticism of democracy, as readers know, but I wonder: is America so fragile? Or is this one of Mencken’s hobgoblins? If so, who benefits? Sheldon Richman is the executive editor of The Libertarian Institute and a contributing editor at Antiwar.com.

      "content": "ATLANTA, Ga. (Atlanta News First) — A Georgia mother who says she’s a U.S. citizen remains locked inside a private immigration detention center, swept up in a wave of federal immigration enforcement that’s bringing historic profits to the company detaining her. Alma Bowman, 58, was taken into custody by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in March during a routine check-in at its Atlanta field office. ICE transferred her the same day to Stewart Detention Center in Lumpkin, Georgia, operated by the private prison contractor CoreCivic, as it initiated deportation proceedings to the Philippines. Bowman’s family, attorneys, and U.S. Rep. Hank Johnson, D-Georgia, argue she is being detained illegally. “She’s an American citizen,” Johnson said. “That has been clearly established. The fact that one of her parents was an American means that she is an American.” Bowman’s father, Lawrence Bowman, was a U.S. Navy serviceman from Illinois stationed in the Philippines during the Vietnam War. Alma Bowman was born there in 1966. Her family moved to the U.S. when she was 10, and she’s lived in Macon for nearly five decades. Military records and her birth certificate lists Lawrence Bowman as her father. Alma Bowman, center, with her father, an American citizen, and her mother. (WANF) Despite that, the federal government revoked her permanent residency following a criminal conviction nearly 20 years ago for writing bad checks totaling $1,200, a debt she paid back. Until March, Bowman had checked in with ICE about once a year while she sought to prove her citizenship since 2020. Her attorney, Samantha Hamilton with Asian Americans Advancing Justice, said ICE gave no explanation for the sudden change. “The rule of law has never seemed to be so meaningless,” Hamilton said. “They want to remove people without respect to that person’s individual circumstances, even if they may be a U.S. citizen.” Hamilton said ICE is violating one of its own polices by holding Bowman. According to ICE Policy 16001.2, titled “Investigating the Potential U.S. Citizenship of Individuals Encountered by ICE,” is a directive issued Nov. 10, 2015, outlining procedures for ICE officers, agents, and attorneys to follow when they encounter individuals who may be U.S. citizens. The policy emphasized ICE cannot assert its civil immigration enforcement authority to arrest or detain U.S. citizens and mandates careful and prompt investigation of potential citizenship claims. Atlanta News First Investigates reached out to ICE for an interview to discuss Bowman’s case. A spokesperson said he would forward the request to the administration, but the agency never responded. CoreCivic, the private prison company housing Bowman, reported record profits during a May 8 earnings call, driven by an influx of immigration detainees under President Donald Trump‘s administration. “Never in our 42-year company history have we had so much activity and demand for our services,” said CEO Damon Hininger. CoreCivic reported $488.6 million in revenue for the first quarter of 2025, with nearly half coming from ICE and U.S. Marshals Service contracts. Hininger said ICE has cited a need for nearly 100,000 beds — more than double its current capacity — as the agency enforces Trump-backed policies such as the Laken Riley Act and executive orders on border security. The Laken Riley Act, signed into law in Jan. 29, 2025, mandates the U.S. Department of Homeland Security to detain undocumented immigrants who are arrested for, charged with, convicted of, or admit to certain crimes, including theft-related offenses. The law is named after the Georgia nursing student murdered in 2024 by Jose Ibarra, a Venezuelan immigrant who was in the U.S. illegally. The law aims to crack down on immigration by requiring federal officials to arrest undocumented immigrants who commit certain crimes related to theft. Since January, CoreCivic has expanded or reactivated facilities across seven states, adding thousands of beds in anticipation of further demand. Advocates say the rise in detentions — and profits — comes at a human cost. “They get money for every person they have in a bed,” Hamilton said. “They dehumanize people so much they just refer to them as beds.” According to data from the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse, more than 2,600 people are currently held in immigration detention across Georgia. About half have no criminal record. Bowman’s sons, John and Chris, said their mother’s detention has devastated their family. “There have been a couple of times I come in her room, and it feels like I can’t breathe,” John said. If she’s deported, Alma Bowman told her sons to sell her beloved collection of action figures — including Deadpool and Pikachu — to raise money. “I couldn’t do it,” Chris said. “It matters too much. It would feel like giving up on her.” “For more than 40 years, CoreCivic has played a limited but important role in America’s immigration system,” said a company spokesperson. “We know this is a highly charged, emotional issue for many people, but the fact is the services we provide help the government solve problems in ways it could not do alone – to help create safer communities by assisting with the current immigration challenges, dramatically improve the standard of care for vulnerable people, and meet other critical needs efficiently and innovatively. “These are problems the American public has made clear they want fixed. “It’s important to understand that CoreCivic has a long-standing, zero-tolerance policy not to advocate for or against any legislation that serves as the basis for – or determines the duration of – an individual’s detention,\" the spokesperson said. “CoreCivic does not enforce immigration laws, arrest anyone who may be in violation of immigration laws, or have any say whatsoever in an individual’s deportation or release. “CoreCivic also does not know the circumstances of individuals when they are placed in our facilities. Our responsibility is to care for each person respectfully and humanely while they receive the legal due process that they are entitled to. ” This is not the first time ICE has detained Alma Bowman. Under Trump’s first term, she was custody from about 2017 to 2020 related to the same deportation claims.

      "content": "Trump Says New Iran Deal Must Allow US To ‘Blow Up Whatever We Want’ President Donald Trump argued that any revived nuclear accord with Iran should permit the United States to destroy the country’s nuclear infrastructure and send inspectors to Iranian facilities at any time. The president outlined his vision for a new agreement during a White House presser on Wednesday, calling for a “very strong document” that would effectively give Washington carte blanche over Tehran’s nuclear energy program. “I want it very strong – where we can go in with inspectors, we can take whatever we want, we can blow up whatever we want, but [with] nobody getting killed,” he told reporters. “We can blow up a lab, but nobody is gonna be in the lab, as opposed to everybody being in the lab and blowing it up.” He did not elaborate on those remarks, however, leaving it unclear whether Washington had actually pushed for such major concessions at the negotiating table. The Islamic Republic would be unlikely to accept a deal under those terms. Ali Shamkhani, a senior adviser to Iran’s supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, later denounced Trump’s comments in a social media post, suggesting his proposal would cross Tehran’s “red lines.” “Efforts to reach Iran’s nuclear plants and ‘blow up their facilities’ have been a dream of previous US presidents,” he wrote. “Iran is an independent state with a strong defense structure, a resilient people, and clear red lines. Negotiations are a means to progress and preserve national interests and honor, not submission and surrender.” During the same news conference on Wednesday, Trump said he had urged Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to refrain from military action against Iran amid the ongoing nuclear talks, arguing the move would be “inappropriate” as the two sides were “very close to a solution.” He went on to claim that a new agreement could be reached with Tehran in “a couple weeks,” though his previous assessments have proven overly optimistic. The threat of an Israeli attack has loomed large over the US-Iran negotiations, as Tel Aviv continues to accuse Tehran of pursuing nuclear weapons despite repeated American intelligence assessments to the contrary. During a visit to Iran last month, Saudi Arabia’s defense chief reportedly warned top Iranian officials that failure to “quickly” reach a deal with the US could prompt airstrikes by Israel. The Saudi minister added that Trump had “little patience for drawn-out negotiations,” and suggested that a new conflict with Tel Aviv would destabilize the region, according to sources cited by Reuters.

      "content": "President Donald Trump sharply increased claims of presidential power in the arena of national security on March 15, 2025, when he invoked the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 to justify new measures targeting the Venezuelan drug-trafficking gang Tren de Aragua (TdA), allegedly an ally of Nicolas Maduro’s government. According to Trump’s proclamation, TdA “is a designated Foreign Terrorist Organization with thousands of members, many of whom have unlawfully infiltrated the United States and are conducting irregular warfare and undertaking hostile actions against the United States.” The organization “has engaged in and continues to engage in mass illegal migration to the United States to further its objectives of harming United States citizens, undermining public safety, and supporting the Maduro regime’s goal of destabilizing democratic nations in the Americas, including the United States.” Collusion between the Maduro regime and TdA, Trump charged, has produced a “hybrid criminal state” that is “perpetuating an invasion of and predatory incursion into the United States,” posing a substantial danger to the country. The president specifically emphasized the alleged “invasion” as the reason for invoking the Alien Enemies Act. He then stated that all alien enemies described in section 1 of his proclamation “are subject to immediate apprehension, detention and removal” from the United States. Opponents of the Trump administration immediately denounced the president’s move as unconstitutional and challenged it in court. The rulings so far have been mixed, but the U.S. Supreme Court has at least slowed the administration’s use of AEA’s deportation proceedings on due process grounds, much to the anger of the White House. Trump’s critics accuse him of trying to implement his hardline views on immigration policy under the false guise of a national security imperative. If Trump’s strategy were allowed to stand, critics contend, undocumented immigrants from Venezuela and other countries could be deported with little or no due process. They would be treated as members of an invading terrorist army. Advocates of a liberal immigration policy consider the invocation of the Alien Enemies Act as a mortal threat to their agenda. One of their most prominent arguments was that the AEA can be implemented only when the United States is at war. Since no congressional declaration of war was in effect against either TdA or Venezuela, their rationale was that the president could not lawfully invoke and implement the Alien Enemies Act. Two factors weaken their argument. First, Trump specifically cited an “invasion” as the justification for his action. It has been long settled law that the president can respond to an invasion without waiting for a declaration of war from Congress. At the Constitutional Convention, James Madison had the original phrase “to make War” changed, to afford the president the ability to respond to sudden attacks. Even the constitutional scholars at the liberal Brennan Center implicitly concede that the administration’s insistence that the U.S. is responding to an invasion might complicate criticism of Trump’s actions: The president may invoke the Alien Enemies Act in times of “declared war” or when a foreign government threatens or undertakes an “invasion” or “predatory incursion” against U.S. territory. The Constitution gives Congress, not the president, the power to declare war, so the president must wait for democratic debate and a congressional vote to invoke the Alien Enemies Act based on a declared war. But the president need not wait for Congress to invoke the law based on a threatened or ongoing invasion or predatory incursion. The president has inherent authority to repel these kinds of sudden attacks — an authority that necessarily implies the discretion to decide when an invasion or predatory incursion is underway. The position adopted by Trump’s opponents is weakened further because Congress has allowed previous presidents to run amok for decades waging undeclared wars in multiple countries. Congress issued the last official declaration of war in June 1942, against Nazi Germany’s allies Hungary, Romania, and Bulgaria. Yet Washington has attacked numerous countries and political movements since then, resulting in extensive deaths and destruction. Indeed, U.S. administrations have waged lengthy, full-scale wars in such places as Korea, Vietnam, Afghanistan, and Iraq. Although Congress made a feeble attempt to reclaim some of its constitutional powers regarding war and peace with the passage of the War Powers Resolution in 1973, that change had a meager effect. The authority of Congress to declare war has become little more than an archaic historical curiosity. It is mighty late for Trump’s opponents to take a stand regarding the limits of the president’s war powers. Their choice of the Alien Enemies Act as the proper vehicle for a constitutional challenge is also questionable, since the current administration can make at least a plausible case that it is responding to an invasion of U.S. territory. Trump’s position that the United States is effectively at war with TdA, thereby warranting the use of the Alien Enemies Act, virtually begs for a landmark decision from the U.S. Supreme Court. His rationale that the United States is being “invaded” by an organized hostile force seems a stretch, but it is decidedly more credible than the arguments that Trump’s predecessors have used to justify their wars and other “emergency actions.” One could certainly assert that the terrorist attacks on 9/11 qualified, and a reasonable case could be made that the Libyan government’s role in the bombing of Pan American flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland, in 1988 constituted an attack on the United States. But any notion that Washington’s warfare against Muslim forces in Lebanon in 1983, bombing the Bosnian Serbs in 1995, bombing Serbia itself in 1999, or invading and occupying Iraq in 2003 (among Washington’s other undeclared wars) were exercises in national self-defense is preposterous on its face. All of those episodes were wars of choice—indeed, gratuitous wars of aggression. The Trump administration’s current case, while probably insufficient, is at least more plausible than the justifications for most of the earlier presidential actions. Yet, many of the most vocal critics of Trump’s behavior regarding his invocation of the Alien Enemies Act were silent about those earlier manifestations of the imperial presidency—and remain so. This episode provides an ideal opportunity for the judicial branch to weigh in about the nature and extent of the war powers of both Congress and the presidency. Such a clarification is badly needed.",

      "content": "DILI, East Timor (AP) — East Timor on Thursday deported a former Filipino congressman charged with multiple murders in the Philippines, saying that he was a national security threat whose presence could damage the country’s image before its entry to the Association of Southeast Asian Nations. Ex-Rep. Arnolfo Teves Jr. was arrested in East Timor’s capital of Dili on Wednesday by immigration authorities and would immediately be deported to the Philippines for staying without a visa and after his passport was cancelled by Manila’s Department of Foreign Affairs, the East Timor government said in a statement. Teves was seen in handcuffs being escorted by East Timor police officers to an awaiting Philippine air force plane. The plane left Dili on Thursday afternoon. Teves had been in Dili for more than two years as he tried to seek asylum, straining relations between the two Southeast Asian democracies. The Philippines has been calling on East Timor to send Teves back to face trial. The Department of Justice in Manila on Thursday welcomed East Timor’s decision and said it has designated a team of justice and immigration officials to help repatriate Teves. East Timor said in a statement that Teves’ presence in the country was “unacceptable” and his stay for more than two years “poses a disruptive factor in bilateral relations between the two states and establishes a serious precedent with potential implications for internal security.” “The perception that Timor-Leste might be viewed as a refuge for individuals fleeing international justice undermines the integrity of our borders and our shared efforts to combat transnational crime,” East Timor said, using the country’s formal name. “The imminent full accession of Timor-Leste to ASEAN, scheduled for October this year, further reinforces the responsibility of the Timorese state to actively collaborate with its regional partners in upholding justice, legality, and stability in the region,” according to East Timor. East Timor President José Ramos-Horta told The Associated Press in an interview in Dili in September that there was “no possibility, under the law” that Teves would be able to remain in East Timor and that he would likely be sent back to the Philippines after his appeal to gain asylum had been exhausted. Teves has been sought by the Philippine government in connection with the March 2023 killings of Negros Oriental Gov. Roel Degamo and several other people, including impoverished villagers seeking medical aid from him, by men in military camouflage and body armor who barged into his central Philippine home with assault rifles. At least 17 others were wounded in the brazen attack, which was captured on security cameras. Teves has denied involvement in the killings, which President Ferdinand Marcos Jr., who was backed by Degamo, then called “purely political.” East Timor, Asia’s youngest country, is in the process of joining the Philippines and nine other countries in the ASEAN, a regional grouping which espouses the rule of law and good governance. It currently has observer status in the regional bloc. Teves’ initial request to seek asylum in East Timor was rejected, a decision which he appealed. In March 2024, police arrested Teves while he was playing at a golf driving range in Dili and it’s not immediately clear how he managed to regain liberty before bring put into custody by immigration authorities on Wednesday. __ Associated Press writers Edna Tarigan in Jakarta, Indonesia, and Jim Gomez in Manila, Philippines, contributed to this report.",

      "content": "This week the United States House of Representatives passed the ridiculously titled “Mobilizing and Enhancing Georgia’s Options for Building Accountability, Resilience, and Independence Act (MEGOBARI Act) by a vote of 349 to 42. The latter “nay” vote consisted of 34 stalwart America First, non-interventionist Republicans and but 8 Dems from the AOC/Squad wing. The rest of the bipartisan UniParty mob voted “yea” in behalf of the stupidest piece of neocon busybody meddling in what is absolutely none of America’s business to yet come down the legislative pike. The “Georgia” in question, of course, is a small country located in an obscure corner of the South Caucasus. What the act does is mobilize the whole of government in Washington – including sanctions, foreign aid and even military might – to punish its leading political party called Georgian Dream for not being sufficiently anti-Russian and pro-Atlanticist. Let’s see. In so far as we can tell the little red spec on the map below could not be located by one in a hundred Congress persons without a color-coded pointer arrow. Self-evidently, Georgia is massively surrounded by the Russian Bear and, in fact, was an integral constituent republic of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics for more than 70 years, having notoriously even given birth to Joseph Stalin himself. And 120 years before that it had been an integral party of Czarist Russia after a predecessor kingdom was annexed in 1801. At the same time, its capital of Tbilisi lies 3,500 kilometers as the crow flies from the nearest thing to the Atlantic, otherwise known as the English Channel. Never in all of history prior to neocon agitation in the last two decade did anyone on the planet associate Georgia with the Atlantic world. So why in hell do these geniuses on the Potomac think this no-count spec of a country doesn’t have the right – in its wisdom or otherwise – to ignore entreaties to join NATO. And, instead, to make nice to its great big next door neighbor and historic kinsman, which has been the policy of the Georgian Dream party since it came to power in 2012. Still, we do mean “spec” of a nation. Georgia’s 3.8 million population is barely that of Los Angeles; it’s $34 billion GDP is equal to about 8 hours of USA output; and it anemic national income per capita of $9,150 is roughly equal to that of the Dominican Republic. So what in the hell does this have to do with US homeland security? And why in the world does Congress insist that Georgia join NATO, which itself should have been disbanded 34 years ago when the Soviet Empire disappeared into the dustbin of history? Besides, Georgia’s tiny armed force of 20,000 is not even half the 53,000 employee headcount of the New York City police department. Yet, the MEGOBARI Act insists that Georgia is crucial to America’s national interest and that it become an ally in the battle against alleged Russian aggression: “[T}he consolidation of democracy in Georgia is critical for regional stability and United States national interests… (so it is) the policy of the United States to support the constitutionally stated aspirations of Georgia to become a member of the European Union and NATO,” to “continue supporting the capacity of the Government of Georgia to protect its sovereignty and territorial integrity… (and) to combat Russian aggression, including through sanctions on trade with Russia and the implementation and enforcement of worldwide sanctions on Russia.” Well, after the calamity of an endless sequence of Forever Wars and the catastrophic $160 billion waste of American treasure on the utterly pointless proxy war against Russia next door in Ukraine, it is damn near impossible to imagine what these fools on Capitol Hill are thinking. The truth is, the homeland security of America doesn’t give a rat’s ass about who governs Georgia and whether its foreign policy is pro-Russian, anti-Russian or punctiliously Swiss-like neutral. And the very last thing Washington should do is attempt to put another NATO stalking horse on Russia’s very doorstep, when the fact of the matter is that Russia is no threat whatsoever to America’s homeland security. To remind:Russia’s $2 trillion GDP is just 7% of America’s $29 trillion economy; it’s ordinary defense budget of $70 billion is also only 7% of the $1.0 trillion monster at the Pentagon; its nuclear force is geared to deterrence just like ours, with nothing even remotely close to a first strike capacity; and its conventional air and sealift capacity is so meager that it couldn’t even get a single battalion on its 1980s era rust bucket aircraft carrier as far as Nantucket before it would be consigned to Davy Jones’ Locker by America’s formidable coastal defenses. In other words, this whole legislative brouhaha on behalf of an “ally” we don’t need, and which doesn’t wish to be one in any event, is aimed at further weakening Russia, which is not a threat to America’s Homeland Security in any way, shape or form. Yet these war-besotted UniParty legislators mean to pull out all the stops in their utterly misguided efforts to push the US Empire deep into the very heartland of Eurasia. Right after declaring it is US policy to impose its will on Georgia and degrade Russia, in fact, the bill mandates the delivery to congressional committees of a specially prepared classified report “examining the penetration of Russian intelligence elements and their assets in Georgia, that includes an annex examining Chinese influence and the potential intersection of Russian-Chinese cooperation in Georgia.” What the f*ck?! It’s none of Washington’s business if the elected Georgian Dream government of a remote micro-country irrelevant to America’s Homeland Security chooses to invite, tolerate or ignore the presence in its country of alleged foreign intelligence operatives. For crying out loud, on that standard the US would have to close half of its 200 embassies around the world because they are crawling with CIA agents operating under diplomatic cover and regime change agents from NED, USAID, the International Broadcasting Agency and others. Indeed, the sheer imperial arrogance of this portion of the bill in particular cannot be gainsaid. The implication of the related sanctions section of the MEGOBARI Act is that Washington would wage economic warfare on a country that has never done America a bit of harm, and has no capacity to do so now, because some ideological dipshits and career politician busybodies in Washington say so. And, yes, we do mean unprovoked Washington warfare against a tiny statelet in the Caucasus. The bill also actually empowers the President to start slinging the go-to interventionist weapon of sanctions against Georgian Parliament members and political party officials who “knowingly engaged in significant acts of corruption, or acts of violence or intimidation in relation to the blocking of Euro-Atlantic integration in Georgia.” There you have it: The US Congress claims to have jurisdiction over the foreign policy of damn near every nation on the planet. And if there were any doubt about this intention, additional statutory language makes that clear that if need be Georgia would drafted for Washington-directed military duty against Russia: “…in consultation with the Secretary of Defense… to expand military co-operation with Georgia, including by providing further security and defense equipment ideally suited for territorial defense against Russian aggression and related training, maintenance, and operations support elements.” If the italicized passage sounds like another Ukraine in the making, the resemblance is actually even more striking. That’s because what we have here is another territorial and ethnic adjustment problem that emanated from the break-up of the Soviet Union. And like in the case of Ukraine, the Washington neocons and arms merchants have gussied it up into a “rule of law” and sovereign border issue, which, also like the case of Ukraine, is not that at all. In fact, like the Washington sponsored coup in Kiev in February 2014, Georgia’s 2003 Rose Revolution, which overthrew Soviet era and Russian friendly President Eduard Shevardnadze, had no small amount of help from the usual Washington suspects – NED, USAID, State and the CIA. Widespread protests, led by Mikheil Saakashvili, a provocateur who had been trained by Washington sponsored NGOs, culminated in demonstrators storming parliament with red roses, demanding Shevardnadze’s resignation. The latter occurred in November 2003 followed by new elections. Backed by by U.S. and European support, including millions from USAID for voter mobilization and George Soros’ Open Society Institute, Saakashvili won the January 2004 presidential election. In turn, this ushered in a pro-Western agenda, seeking NATO and EU integration and aiming to restore Georgia’s territorial integrity over the breakaway provinces of South Ossetia and Abkhazia. Accordingly, his government then massively increased military spending (from 0.8% of GDP in 2003 to 8% by 2008) and conducted operations to reassert control over these separatist regions, resulting in the 2004 clashes in South Ossetia and the 2006 Kodori Gorge operation in Abkhazia. These breakaway regions depicted in the map below were distinct ethnic enclaves that spoke an Iranian dialect different from the main population of Georgia. During Soviet times, in fact, these two provinces had been administrated independently from the Georgian Republic because even the communists could see that the populations weren’t compatible. So when the Soviet Union fell, both provinces declared their independence and operated thereafter on a de facto separatist basis. However, escalating tensions in South Ossetia between the large Ossetian majority and minority Georgian villages led Saakashvili to launch a military offensive on August 2008, targeting Tskhinvali, the South Ossetian capital. A latter EU report on the conflict condemned Georgia’s “indiscriminate artillery barrage” as the cause of the war’s inception. As it happened, there was also a significant Ossetian population in North Ossetia, which had remained within Russia after the 1991 dissolution of the USSR. Consequently, Russia responded to the Georgian offensive with a massive counterattack that repelled the Georgian army from South Ossetia and led to a Franc-brokered truce that left South Ossetia and Abkhazia occupied by Russian forces. Subsequently, these two breakaway regions were recognized by Moscow as independent states and have remained outside Georgian control ever since. Even then, however, Saakashvili’s miscalculation in launching the 2008 war on South Ossetia and ongoing economic failures in Georgia led to his own downfall in 2012. In October of that year the pro-Russian Georgian Dream (GD), led by billionaire Bidzina Ivanishvili, came to power through a democratic victory in parliamentary elections, winning 55% of the vote and defeating Mikheil Saakashvili’s United National Movement (UNM). Still, the purely local ethnic dispute of 2008, in areas so tiny that they would barely amount to a pinprick in the black box depicting the location of Georgia in the upper right hand corner of the map, has become the basis for the neocon claim that Russia is a dangerous expansionist power that must be stopped at all hazards. And that’s just crazy. In the global scheme of recent history, the 2008 South Ossetia conflict in this obscure corner of the planet that led to but 228 civilian casualties and 169 military deaths was a nothing-burger. It as among the dozen of broken “nationalities” omelettes that were scattered around the Russian borderlands when the Soviet Union fell and centuries of Czarist and Communist territorial expansion came suddenly, and often, violently undone. Stated differently, there were no universal principles at stake in the manner in which the bits and pieces of the Soviet Empire were sorted out after 1991. That was just a one-time accident of history that had no bearing whatsoever on the Homeland Security of America. Accordingly, it was simply the ideological aggression of the Washington War Party and its MIC (military-industrial complex) paymasters which made it so. And that occurred especially through obsolete institutions like NATO and the so-called Helsinki Commission of the US Congress – the later being the actual instigator of this absurd piece of busy-body legislation. Yet and yet. Washington has not stopped its efforts to provoke an anti-Russian posture in Tbilisi even when its own government since 2012 has elected to remain friendly with its Russian neighbor and historic suzerain and to eschew any effort to join NATO. This is all clear enough. The MEGOBARI Act is blistering idiocy. Nothing that has transpired over the last three decades on the map above pertains to the homeland security of America 10,000 kilometers away on the far side of the Atlantic moat. Yet the fact that an overwhelming majority of the US House this week saw fit to enact this foolishness tells you that Washington has indeed become the War Capital of the World. Instead of getting down to the true business at hand – stanching the nation’s vast flow of budgetary red ink via sweeping entitlement reform and slashing American hideously bloated $1.0 trillion military budget by 50% – the UniParty majority clings to the delusional business of a failing Empire. Moreover, there is no mystery as to why. After decades of Warfare State and MIC (military-industrial complex) domination of Capitol Hill there are few elected officials left who even experienced the real Cold War before 1991. So they cling to its now wholly vestigial institutions like NATO and globe-spanning alliances when none are needed in today’s multi-polar world. Indeed, examination of the careers of the four main UniParty sponsors of this utterly absurd piece of legislation tell you all you need to know. They are careerist politicians who have collectively served in Congress for 65 years, and have spent 128 years between them on the public teat. Naturally, careerist time-servers are ever on the look-out for missions and projects to justify their existence and for occasion to throw their weight around. But attempting to enlist the no-count state of Georgia against the will of its own electorate in Washington’s absurd crusade against Putin and Russia surely sinks to a level of mendacity that is just downright embarrassing.",

      "content": "Marco Rubio Says ‘Vigorous New Visa Policy’ Will Prevent Israel Critics From Entering the US Rubio said the US will hold 'international organizations and nations accountable for rhetoric against Israel' Secretary of State Marco Rubio said on Wednesday that the US was implementing a “vigorous new visa policy” to prevent people from entering the US who are critical of Israel, which he conflates with antisemitism. “We have implemented a vigorous new visa policy that will prevent foreign nationals from coming to the United States to foment hatred against our Jewish community,” Rubio said in a recorded video message to an Israeli conference on “combating antisemitism.” Rubio said that the US will hold “international organizations and nations accountable for rhetoric against Israel.” The Trump administration recently paused all interviews for foreigners seeking student visas as it prepares to expand vetting and screening of social media. The Trump administration has been attempting to deport foreign students for protesting against Israel’s genocidal war in Gaza, activism that US officials have labeled “antisemitic” despite Jewish involvement in the demonstrations. In one case, Rubio revoked the visa of a PhD student at Tufts University, Rumeysa Ozturk, for co-authoring an op-ed that called for her school to divest from Israeli companies. Ozturk was recently released after six weeks of detention and continues to fight against her deportation. In a seemingly contradictory move, Rubio also announced a new policy to prevent foreign nationals who have been involved in censoring the speech of Americans from obtaining visas. “Today, I am announcing a new visa restriction policy that will apply to foreign nationals who are responsible for censorship of protected expression in the United States,” Rubio said. “It is unacceptable for foreign officials to issue or threaten arrest warrants on US citizens or US residents for social media posts on American platforms while physically present on US soil.”",

      "content": "Your 'aid' system will lead to chaos, as desperate, starving people fight for food. That’s great. They look like a swarming mass of the very 'human animals' you were talking about from the start A short guide on how to engineer a genocide by starvation and ethnic cleansing: 1. Choose your moment. OK, you’ve been ethnically cleansing, occupying, oppressing and killing your neighbors for decades. The international courts have ruled your actions illegal. But none of that will matter the moment your neighbors retaliate by attacking you. Don’t worry. The western media can be relied on to help out here. They will be only too ready to pretend that history began on the day you were attacked. 2. Declare, in response, your intention to starve your neighbors, treating them as “human animals”, by blocking all food, water and power. You will be surprised by how many western politicians are ready to support this as your “right to defend yourself”. The media will echo them. Important not to just talk about blocking aid. You must actually do it. There will be no serious pushback for many, many months. 3. Start relatively slowly. Time is on your side. Let a little bit of aid in. But make sure to relentlessly smear the well functioning, decades-old aid distribution system run by the international community – one that is transparent, accountable and widely integrated into the community it serves. Say it is infiltrated by “terrorists”. 4. Use that claim – evidence isn’t really necessary, the western media never ask for it – as the pretext to bomb the aid system’s warehouses, distribution centers and community kitchens. Oh, and don’t forget to bomb all the private bakeries, destroy all the farmland, shoot all the animals and kill anyone who tries to use a fishing boat, so that there are no other sources of food. You are now in control of the trickle of aid reaching what is rapidly becoming a severely malnourished population. 5. Time to move into higher gear. Stop the international community’s aid getting in all together. You will need a humanitarian cover story for this bit. The danger, particularly in an age of social media, is that images of starving babies will make you look very bad. Hold firm. You can get through this. Claim – again evidence isn’t really necessary, the western media won’t ask for it – that the “terrorists” are stealing the aid. You will be surprised how willing the media is to talk about babies going “hungry”, ignoring the fact that you are starving them to death, or speak of a “famine”, as though from drought and crop failure, not from your carefully laid plans. 6. Don’t lose sight of the bigger story. You are blocking aid to “eradicate the terrorists”. After all, what is the worth of a baby, of a child – all 1 million of them – in the fight to eliminate a rag-tag army of lightly armed “terrorists” who have never waged their struggle outside of their historic homeland. 7. Now that the population are entirely at your disposal, you can roll out a “humanitarian” alternative to the existing system you have been vilifying and wrecking. Probably best to have been working on this part of the plan behind the scenes from early on, and to have regularly consulted with the Americans on how to develop it. You may even find they are willing to fund it. They usually are. You can obscure their role by using the term “private contractors”. 8. It’s time for implementation. Obviously, the point is not to really distribute aid. It is all about providing a cover story so that the starvation and ethnic cleansing can continue. Make sure you provide only a tiny amount of aid and make it available only at a few distribution points you have set up with these “private contractors”. This has two advantages. 9. It forces the population to come to the areas you want them in. Like luring mice into a trap. Get them to the very edge of the territory, because from there you will be best positioned at some point to drive them over the border and get rid of them for good. 10. Your system will lead to chaos, as desperate, starving people fight for food. That’s great for you. It makes them look like a swarming mass of those “human animals” you were talking about from the start. Don’t they deserve their fate? And it means that young, fit men – especially those from large, often armed, criminal families – will end up with most of the food. The stuff they can’t grab at the distribution points, they will ambush later as people try to return home laden with their heavy aid packages. That may seem counter-productive, given that you’re claiming to want to eliminate the “terrorists”. Won’t these fit, young men, as conditions degenerate further, provide a future source of recruits to the “terrorists”. But remember, the real goal here is to starve the population as quickly as possible. The young, the elderly, the sick and the vulnerable are the ones who will die first. The more of them who start dying, the faster the pressure builds on everyone else to flee the territory to save themselves. You are nearly there. True, faced with the emaciated bodies of your victims, western politicians will start making harsh pronouncements. But they have already given you a massive head start of 20 months. Be grateful for that. You don’t need much longer. While they dither, you can get on with the job of extermination. Leave it to the history books to judge what really happened.

      "authors": [],
      "content": "US electronic design automation software makers were told via letters to stop supplies to China, the FT reported. United States President Donald Trump’s administration has ordered US firms that offer software used to design semiconductors to stop selling their services to Chinese groups, the Financial Times has reported, citing people familiar with the move. Electronic design automation software makers, which include Cadence, Synopsys and Siemens EDA, were told via letters from the US Commerce Department to stop supplying their tech, the report, which was published on Wednesday, said. A spokesperson for the Commerce Department declined to comment on the letters but said it is reviewing exports of strategic significance to China, while noting that, “in some cases, Commerce has suspended existing export licenses or imposed additional license requirements while the review is pending”. Shares of Cadence, which declined to comment, closed down by 10.7 percent, while shares of Synopsys fell by 9.6 percent. Synopsys CEO Sassine Ghazi said in a call with analysts that the company had not received a letter, nor had it heard from the Commerce Department’s Bureau of Industry (BIS) and Security, which enforces export controls. “We are aware of the reporting and speculations, but Synopsys has not received a notice from BIS. So, our guidance that we are reiterating for the full year, reflects our current understanding of BIS export restrictions as well as our expectations for year-over-year decline in China. We have not received a letter,” Ghazi said. After the market closed, Synopsys reaffirmed its revenue forecast for 2025. Its shares and those of Cadence bounced back 3.5 percent in trading after the close. Advertisement Siemens EDA did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The software of these firms is used to design both high-end processors as well as simpler products. While the scope of the policy change described in the report was not immediately clear, any move to strip the software makers of their Chinese customers could deal a blow to their bottom line and to their Chinese chip design customers, which heavily rely on top-of-the-line US software. “They are the true choke point,” said a former Commerce Department official, who added that rules restricting the export of EDA tools to China have been under consideration since the first Trump administration, but were ruled out as too aggressive. Synopsys relies on China for about 16 percent of its annual revenue, while China accounts for about 12 percent of annual revenue for Cadence. Synopsys, which partners with chip companies such as Nvidia, Qualcomm and Intel, provides software and hardware used for designing advanced processors.",

      "content": "The collapse of Bashar al-Assad’s rule is an opportunity for the US to overhaul its bankrupt Syria policy. The US should have abandoned this policy years earlier, but now there are no longer any pretexts for continuing the collective punishment of the Syrian people and the illegal American military presence on Syrian soil. The time has come for rapid sanctions relief and immediate withdrawal of US forces. The US must finally leave Syria alone. US troops currently in Syria have no good reason to be there. Successive administrations have kept troops in Syria in the name of combating the Islamic State, but it has been clear for years that their real unstated purpose has been to oppose Iranian influence. Iran withdrew its forces from Syria prior to Assad’s departure, and it is unlikely that a new Syrian government will be welcoming them back anytime soon. Now Washington can’t use the specter of Iran to excuse keeping hundreds of soldiers in a country where they have no business being. Whatever form the Syrian government takes, it will be within its rights to demand the departure of all foreign forces from its territory. The US shouldn’t wait to be told to leave. It would be a good idea to remove US forces quickly from the country to avoid any chance of conflicts or accidental clashes. Once US troops are out of Syria, there will be no reason to have a US military presence in Iraq, either. The US has been illegally at war in Syria for the last nine years. Congress never authorized any use of force or deployments in Syria, and there is no international mandate for US forces to operate in Syria. The US has been flagrantly violating international law and trampling on Syrian sovereignty for almost a decade. That needs to end at once. Now that Assad is no longer in power, there is no possible justification for keeping punishing broad sanctions in place. These sanctions were always destructive and mainly harmed the civilian population by throttling the economy and preventing reconstruction. Sanctions have exacerbated the country’s severe humanitarian crisis and impeded the delivery of aid. Broad sanctions were a terrible policy when Assad was still in control, and they are completely indefensible now that he is gone. Congress should repeal existing sanctions legislation, and the next administration should lift or suspend as many sanctions as they can. The US must not make the same mistake it made in Afghanistan when it penalized the Afghan people with economic warfare after Washington’s client government collapsed. The worst thing that the US could do right now is to delay sanctions relief for Syria or attempt to use sanctions as leverage to try to influence the direction of Syrian politics. Syria’s future is for its people to decide, and the US should butt out. Trump has signaled that he has no interest in US involvement in Syrian affairs in the future. That is welcome news if it holds true. The last time that Trump indicated that he wanted to get US forces out of Syria, he met significant resistance from within his own administration and from the military and he ended up leaving a military presence in the country. This time nothing should stop a complete withdrawal from happening. It cannot be framed as a concession to Assad, because he is no longer there. It cannot be misrepresented as a gift to Iran, since Iran has already pulled out of the country. The Syrian war proved beyond any doubt that outside intervention intensifies and prolongs conflict. If not for the endless and destructive meddling of the US, European states, Russia, Turkey, the Gulf states, and Israel, the war in Syria might have ended much earlier with far fewer casualties. The people of Syria were made to suffer for the disastrous ambitions of these outside powers. If Syria’s neighbors and other powers had respected Syria’s sovereignty, both Syria and the wider region might have suffered much less violence and upheaval. The US should be prepared to assist in humanitarian relief efforts when asked, but otherwise Syria has received enough “help” from Washington to last a lifetime. The US should move quickly to remove all impediments to foreign investment and reconstruction that it has set up. Then it should keep its hands off a country that it has done so much to devastate.

      "content": "Aid workers are also having to cope with a wave of cholera outbreaks in war-torn Sudan. The World Food Programme (WFP) has said it is “shocked and alarmed” that its premises in southwestern Sudan have been hit by repeated shelling from the Rapid Support Forces (RSF), as the paramilitary group wages a brutal civil war, now in its third year, with the Sudanese army. “Humanitarian staff, assets, operations and supplies should never be a target. This must stop now”, the United Nations body said on X on Thursday. El-Fasher is the last major city held by the Sudanese army in the Darfur region. It has witnessed intense fighting between the army and RSF since May 2024, despite international warnings about the risks of violence in a city that serves as a key humanitarian hub for the five Darfur states. For more than a year, the RSF has sought to wrest control of el-Fasher, located more than 800km (500 miles) southwest of the capital, Khartoum, from the army, launching regular attacks on the city and two major famine-hit camps for displaced people on its outskirts. Adding to humanitarian woes on the ground, the Health Ministry in Khartoum state on Thursday reported 942 new cholera infections and 25 deaths the previous day, following 1,177 cases and 45 deaths the day before. Aid workers say the scale of the cholera outbreak is deteriorating due to the near-total collapse of health services, with about 90 percent of hospitals in key war zones no longer operational. Since August 2024, Sudan has reported more than 65,000 suspected cholera cases and at least 1,700 deaths across 12 of its 18 states. Khartoum alone has seen 7,700 cases and 185 deaths, including more than 1,000 infections in children under five, as it contends with more than two years of fighting between the army and the RSF. Advertisement Sudan’s army-backed government in Khartoum state announced earlier this month that all relief initiatives in the state must register with the Humanitarian Aid Commission (HAC), a government body that oversees humanitarian operations in Sudan. Aid workers and activists are fearful these regulations will lead to a crackdown on local relief volunteers, exacerbating the catastrophic hunger crisis affecting 25 million people across the country. The HAC was given expanded powers to register, monitor and, critics argue, crack down on local and Western aid groups by former leader Omar al-Bashir in 2006, according to aid groups, local relief volunteers and experts. The army-backed government announced last week that it had dislodged RSF fighters from their last bases in Khartoum state, two months after retaking the heart of the capital from the paramilitaries. The city, nonetheless, remains devastated with health and sanitation infrastructure barely functioning. The RSF has been battling the SAF for control of Sudan since April 2023. The civil war has killed more than 20,000 people, uprooted 15 million and created what the UN considers the world’s worst humanitarian crisis.",

      "content": "Deal-making is said to be President Trump’s specialty, yet after five rounds of indirect talks with Iran – most recently just days ago – we seem as far away from an agreement as ever. The fifth round ended last Friday with no breakthrough, but at least no breakdown. However, each day that passes without a document signed on the table is another day for the neocons to maneuver the US president toward an attack on Iran. One way the war party does this is to continuously move the goal posts and change the rules of the game. Trump envoy Steve Witkoff, under great pressure from the neocons, has himself signaled at least three position-shifts: from no enrichment at all, to low-level enrichment for civilian uses, back to no enrichment at all. The neocons know that Iran will not give up its right to the civilian use of nuclear power and that is why they are applying maximum pressure to force Trump to officially adopt that position. They know if that becomes the US “red line” then they will win and they will get their war. Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu, in league with US neocons, has been warning us for 20 years that Iran is “months away” from a nuclear weapon – even though our own Intelligence Community recently re-affirmed that Iran is not working on a nuclear weapon at all. Of course this is the same Netanyahu who promised Congress in 2002 if the US would just invade Iraq, peace and prosperity would break out in the Middle East. “If you take out Saddam, Saddam’s regime,” he told Congress in March of that year, “I guarantee you that it will have enormous positive reverberations on the region.” We know how that worked out. Poll after poll shows that the American people are tired of intervention and tired of Middle East wars. President Trump himself recognized this in his scathing rebuke of neocons and interventionists during a recent speech in Saudi Arabia. But rebuke in a speech is not enough. President Trump must actively turn away from the neocons – many of whom are prominent in his own administration. The recent US debacle in Yemen – where billions were wasted, civilians killed, and US military equipment destroyed – is just a taste of what the US would be in for if the neocons get their way and take us to war with Iran. The Iranian foreign minister laid down in the simplest terms how the impasse could be solved, posting on X that, “Zero nuclear weapons = we DO have a deal; Zero enrichment = we do NOT have a deal. My own preference is non-intervention and I do not believe Iran has the desire or the ability to militarily harm the United States. I share President Trump’s view that it would be far better to re-establish relations with Iran and begin mutually beneficial trade with the country. But if a mutually acceptable nuclear deal is the best way to take the neocon war with Iran off the table, then a deal is worth supporting. President Trump should make his position clear to his negotiators: no more waffling or contradictions, get this agreement signed and put one in the “win” column.",

      "content": "Former Egyptian presidential hopeful Ahmed Tantawi was released from prison on Wednesday after serving a one-year sentence for election-related offences, his lawyer told AFP. \"Tantawi is now in his home\" in the Nile Delta city of Kafr el-Sheikh, Khaled Ali said, confirming that the politician had been transferred from a prison around 50 kilometres (30 miles) from Cairo. Tantawi, a former member of parliament and vocal critic of President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, had sought to challenge the incumbent in the 2023 presidential vote. But he and 22 campaign staff were convicted of \"circulating unauthorised election materials\" - a charge critics saw as a thinly veiled blocking tactic. The 45-year-old Tantawi had accused authorities of sabotaging his effort to gather the 25,000 official endorsements required to enter the race, citing repeated technical failures in government-run systems. In response, he turned to \"popular endorsement forms\" filled out by supporters - an improvisation that prosecutors later branded as electoral fraud. He ultimately fell short, collecting just 14,000 signatures, and withdrew his candidature. Sisi won a third term with a landslide 89.6 percent of the votes cast. Rights groups including Human Rights Watch described the 2023 election as tightly controlled, saying the government deployed \"an array of repressive tools to eliminate challengers\", including jailing another candidate, Hisham Kassem. Tantawi's legal troubles did not end with his sentencing. In April this year, just weeks before his scheduled release, he was questioned in connection with two other cases. Prosecutors charged him with \"inciting a terrorist act\" and \"inciting a public gathering\" for allegedly calling for demonstrations against the war in Gaza in October 2023 - accusations he denied. The new accusations raised fears about Egypt's so-called \"revolving door policy\" in which dissidents are freed only to be rearrested on new charges.",

      "content": "Mold painted over, wires dangling and black rusted pipes framing the ceiling were part of everyday reality for Marines, sailors and airmen living in barracks on Guam. The conditions left the Navy’s top admiral in charge of barracks across the service baffled. Photos of the Palau Hall barracks at Andersen Air Force Base, Guam, and comments in an email from a senior Navy official were obtained by the Project on Government Oversight and shared with Task & Purpose. “It is baffling to discover sailors living in these conditions,” Vice Adm. Scott Gray, the head of Navy Installations Command, wrote in a May 5 email obtained by POGO. Guam is home to nearly 21,000 U.S. military personnel and their families from three of the services. In 2024, the U.S. began moving Marines who were based in Japan to the Pacific island and opened a new installation earlier this month called Camp Blaz. Before the Marine Corps installation was established, Guam was home to Andersen Air Force Base and Naval Base Guam. There are currently around 430 airmen and soldiers living in the barracks at Andersen Air Force Base, with 77 airmen in Palau Hall specifically, according to an Air Force spokesperson. There were previously 25 Marines and 48 sailors living in the Palau Hall barracks before they were moved at the direction of Navy Secretary John Phelan after a base tour in early May. Phelan was “shocked and dismayed” at the barracks conditions, Capt. Adam Clampitt, a spokesperson for the secretary, told Task & Purpose. Phelan directed that Marines and sailors be moved within 10 days and that Camp Blaz open in mid-May, a month ahead of schedule, he said. The Marine Corps and Navy personnel who were living in the Air Force barracks were part of a helicopter rescue squadron. The hangar used by their unit was destroyed in a 2023 typhoon, moving their aircraft and jobs to a different section of the base. In order to be closer to the new hangar, the troops moved to Palau Hall, Clampitt said. Phelan, who was sworn in as Secretary of the Navy in March, visited the billeting as part of a wider tour of installations in the Pacific. “This was the angriest I’ve seen the secretary when he saw the condition of these,” Clampitt said, adding that Phelan pointed out the juxtaposition of a pristine golf course nearby on base. ‘Failure of leadership‘ In his May 5 email, Vice Adm. Gray called the conditions of the Guam barracks a “failure of leadership” across multiple commands, stating that the barracks are “clearly way outside any reasonable standard” and “clearly lack any sense of ownership.” Gray also directed a Navy-wide inspection of barracks by May 27 that included an interior and exterior check, review of staffing levels, amenities like Wi-Fi and kitchens, and plans to improve conditions or relocate sailors. In his inspection instructions, he also said to apply the “Washington Post test,” adding that if pictures taken during the assessment were published online, “would you be able to personally justify sailors living there?” In the interim, Gray said in his email that the priority was to make sure the barracks “meet the ‘mom test.’” If they didn’t, he directed that sailors and marines be moved to more “suitable quarters.” Cmdr. Alana Garas, a spokesperson for Navy Installation Command, said inspections are ongoing, but that as of Wednesday, all regions have reported on most of their unaccompanied housing facilities. Garas said that Vice Adm. Gray’s email reiterated the responsibility of Navy commanding officers to ensure that inspections take place to “maintain safe and healthy living conditions” for sailors, “whether the unaccompanied housing facilities are Navy-owned or not.” The barracks are run by the Air Force, so Clampitt said they are not in charge of handing down punishments for the dilapidating conditions. “The Air Force expects commanders to regularly inspect permanent party living conditions to ensure service members have safe housing. Installation commanders assign dorm leaders to occupied, permanent party dorms who inspect their facilities daily,” An Air Force spokesperson told Task & Purpose in a statement. Barracks issues have become a hot button issue in recent years with Congress standing up a Quality of Life panel and a damning Government Accountability Office report stating that they posed health and safety issues for troops. Millions have been put towards barracks in previous defense funding bills, and another $1 billion for maintenance and upgrades at Army, Navy, Air Force, and Space Force barracks is being requested in a congressional spending bill, which has passed the House and heads to the Senate. The Air Force spokesperson said that the service faces “several environmental elements” in Guam and that “harsh conditions accelerate the rate at which materials deteriorate and reduce their overall lifespan.” The latest on Task & Purpose 18 Army Rangers suspended for allegedly firing blanks at Florida beach Hegseth announces accountability review of Afghanistan withdrawal Coast Guard rescue swimmers saved a worker stuck in hardening concrete after roof collapse This National Guard unit went completely analog to simulate a cyber attack Fewer reenlistment options for soldiers amid high Army retention",

      "content": "President Donald Trump meets with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in the Oval Office on April 7, 2025. (Photo by Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images) Benjamin Netanyahu has made it clear: His decision to allow a minuscule amount of aid to enter Gaza is a tactical one aimed at quieting international condemnation of Israel’s forced starvation of Gaza and to clear the path of a final solution imposed on the Palestinians of Gaza. \"We're going to take control of all the Gaza Strip,” Netanyahu vowed Monday in a video released by his office announcing that Israel would begin delivering “minimal humanitarian aid: food and medicine only.” Netanyahu claimed that international pressure, including from pro-Israel Republican senators and the White House, required the appearance of humanitarian intervention. \"Our best friends in the world—senators I know as strong supporters of Israel—have warned that they cannot support us if images of mass starvation emerge,\" he said. “They come to me and say, ‘We’ll give you all the help you need to win the war… but we can’t be receiving pictures of famine,’” Netanyahu added. To continue the war of annihilation, he asserted, “We need to do it in a way that they won't stop us.” Netanyahu’s coalitional ally Bezalel Smotrich—an extreme right-wing government minister and longtime advocate of starving, mass killing, and depopulating Gaza—endorsed Netanyahu’s move. Smotrich said the aid scheme would allow “our friends in the world to continue to provide us with an international umbrella of protection against the Security Council and the Hague Tribunal, and for us to continue to fight, God willing, until victory.” In what he described as an emergency press conference to address criticism from his own base, Smotrich laid out the Netanyahu government’s genocidal agenda and explained why the appearance of allowing aid is necessary on a strategic level. “The [aid] that will enter Gaza in the coming days is the tiniest amount. A handful of bakeries that will hand out pita bread to people in public kitchens. People in Gaza will get a pita and a food plate, and that's it. Exactly what we are seeing in the videos: people standing in line and waiting to have someone serve them, with some soup plate,” Smotrich said. “Truth be told, until the last of the hostages returns, we should also not let water into the Gaza Strip. But the reality is that if we do that, the world will force us to halt the war immediately, and to lose. It would be winning the battle, and losing the war. I'm committed to winning the war,” Smotrich declared. “We are disassembling Gaza, and leaving it as piles of rubble, with total destruction [which has] no precedent globally. And the world isn't stopping us. There are pressures. There are those who attack [us]; they are trying to [make us] stop; they are not succeeding. You know why they aren't succeeding? Because we are navigating [the campaign] responsibly and wisely, and that's how we'll continue to do [it].\" Smotrich said that the Israeli forces are initiating a campaign to force Palestinians into the south of Gaza “and from there, God willing, to third countries, as part of President Trump's plan. This is a change of the course of history—nothing less.” In recent days, Trump has resumed promoting the threat he first floated on February 4 when Netanyahu visited him at the White House: that the U.S. would seize Gaza and create a Middle East Riviera. “I think I’d be proud to have the United States have it, take it, make it a freedom zone,” Trump said Thursday, an assertion he repeated over the weekend in an interview with FOX News. “Gaza is a nasty place. It's been that way for years. I think it should become a free zone, you know, freedom, I call it a freedom zone,” Trump told host Bret Baier. On Sunday, Netanyahu said that allowing “a basic amount of food” to enter Gaza was pursued out of “the operational need to enable the expansion of the intense fighting to defeat Hamas.” He said that Israel would resume limited aid deliveries on an interim basis starting approximately a week ahead of a longer term aid plan that would circumvent the UN and other international agencies. The emerging Israeli policy offers enough food to Palestinians in Gaza to ward off international condemnation that could impact its war, while preparing to ethnically cleanse Palestinians from Gaza. Netanyahu’s announcement comes amid renewed talks over a possible Gaza ceasefire and exchange of captives deal. Netanyahu has insisted he will not make any agreement that ends the war without the total elimination of Hamas and the demilitarization of the entire Gaza Strip. Hamas has said it will not release any more Israeli captives held in Gaza unless an internationally certified deal is reached that includes the total withdrawal of Israeli forces and a long-term truce. “We are ready to release the prisoners in one batch, provided the occupation commits to an internationally guaranteed ceasefire,” said Sami Abu Zuhri, head of Hamas’s Political Bureau Abroad, on Sunday. He told Al Jazeera Mubashar, “We will not hand over our prisoners to the occupation as long as it continues to insist on continuing its aggression against Gaza indefinitely.” Strategies of Conquest The Trump administration has publicly continued to fully back Netanyahu as the Israeli army intensifies its campaign of terror bombings and forced displacement across Gaza. The White House has offered no public criticism of Netanyahu’s operation, called “Gideon’s Chariot,” aimed at seizing control of all of Gaza in what officials have described as a “conquest.” Before Trump set off on his Middle East tour, during which he notably did not stop in Israel, Netanyahu announced this new phase to his war of annihilation in Gaza. If Hamas did not surrender and agree to release all Israeli captives by the time Trump returned to Washington, D.C., Israel would initiate a large-scale ground invasion and occupation of the entire Gaza Strip. Over the weekend, Israeli forces began intensifying ground operations and expanded its relentless campaign of bombings and air strikes. Israeli forces attacked several hospitals and camps for displaced people in operations that killed more than 500 Palestinians in just a few days. Missile strikes rained down on the southern city of Khan Younis accompanied by helicopter gunship attacks and artillery shelling. On Monday, Israel issued sweeping forced evacuation orders in the south, including the entire governorate of Khan Younis, that forced panicked residents to grab what they could and flee to sites Israel has previously designated as safe zones, including Al-Mawasi, which the Israeli military then later attacked. Trump has pursued an increasingly close alliance with Arab Gulf leaders, who represent massive business opportunities for both his political and personal agenda. Trump’s deal-making has created some technical hurdles for Netanyahu’s murderous agenda. While the rulers of these states did not publicly demand that Trump impose a ceasefire or intervene to halt Netanyahu’s genocidal march, reports indicate that they did privately urge him to act swiftly to resume aid shipments to Gaza and to utilize U.S. influence to compel Netanyahu to halt the genocide. During his recent tour of Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates, Trump said little about Gaza, but he did pledge to confront the humanitarian crisis and said that aid delivery would resume. “Look, people are starving,” Trump said Saturday in an interview on FOX News. “I’ve already started working on that.” Israeli officials have said that the White House had begun pressuring Netanyahu to allow a partial lifting of the blockade. “I don’t think there’s any daylight between President Trump’s position and Prime Minister Netanyahu's position,” said Steve Witkoff, Trump’s special envoy, on Sunday in an interview with ABC News. “Everyone is concerned about the humanitarian conditions in Gaza,” he added. “We do not want to see a humanitarian crisis, and we will not allow it to occur on President Trump’s watch.” As Drop Site reported on Friday, Hamas said its decision to release U.S. citizen and Israeli soldier Edan Alexander last Monday was the result of a direct commitment from Witkoff. According to Basem Naim, a member of Hamas’s political bureau, Witkoff made a direct commitment that, two days after Alexander’s release, the Trump administration would compel Israel to lift the Gaza blockade and allow humanitarian aid to immediately enter the territory. Witkoff, Naim said, also promised that Trump would make a public call for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza and for negotiations aimed at achieving a “permanent ceasefire.” Naim said the U.S. “threw [the deal] in the trash.” Both Israel and the U.S. have been promoting plans to deliver aid to Gaza that would circumvent a ceasefire deal, which the United Nations and all aid groups operating in Gaza have said would be necessary in order to address the acute humanitarian crisis. Instead, the U.S. and Israel have concocted a scheme involving a newly established “non-governmental” foundation run by a former U.S. marine to take official charge of establishing zones, mostly in southern Gaza, to distribute a limited number of rations. Palestinians wishing to receive aid would have to go through an Israeli security vetting process and subject themselves to checkpoints and facial recognition technology as a condition for receiving food. On Monday, Netanyahu said the sites would be located in “a sterile area controlled entirely by the IDF.” The UN and over 200 non-governmental aid organizations have denounced the plan, saying it is unworkable and weaponizes aid as a tool of war. The main UN humanitarian organization operating in the Occupied Palestinian Territories said the plan was aimed at dismantling the international infrastructure built over several decades and further enforcing Israeli dominance over access to basic life sustaining food and supplies for Palestinians in Gaza. “It contravenes fundamental humanitarian principles and appears designed to reinforce control over life-sustaining items as a pressure tactic – as part of a military strategy,” asserted the country team of the UN Humanitarian Coordinator for the Occupied Palestinian Territory on May 5. “It is dangerous, driving civilians into militarized zones to collect rations, threatening lives, including those of humanitarian workers, while further entrenching forced displacement.” Leave a comment",

      "content": "Despite the GHF saying it distributed 8,000 food boxes on Tuesday, amounting to 462,000 meals, Al Jazeera correspondent Hind al-Khourdary said the rations would do little to sustain families for long. Khoudary described a typical box with 4kg (8.8lb) of flour, a couple of bags of pasta, two cans of fava beans, a pack of tea bags and some biscuits. Other food parcels contained lentils and soup in small quantities. “We have been dying of starvation. We have to feed our children who want to eat. What else can we do? I could do anything to feed them,” a Palestinian father told Al Jazeera. “We saw people running, and we followed them, even if it meant taking a risk, and it was scary. But fear is not worse than starvation.” Despite her best efforts, by the time Abu Sa’da, the mother of three, made it to Rafah, it was too late. Abu Sa’da described the experience as deeply humiliating. She was filled with shame and inferiority. “I covered my face with my scarf the whole time. I didn’t want anyone to recognise me going to get a food parcel,” she added. Still, Abu Sa’da says she would do it again if needed. Limited water and electricity Water is scarce and electricity is almost non-existent in Gaza, making it nearly impossible for people to use the limited supplies they manage to obtain. Reporting live from Deir el-Balah, Al Jazeera correspondent Tareq Abu Azzoum explained that it is “impossible to cook any dry food in Gaza - including lentils, rice, or even pasta - without having water\". \"And if you had water, you would also need electricity or a fuel source, which have both been completely cut off entirely from Gaza,\" he said. What is the GHF? The Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) is a newly established, US- and Israeli-approved organisation that is distributing food to Palestinians in Gaza. The organisation has already been marred with delays and difficulties, with the United Nations saying the group does not have the ability to deal with the dire humanitarian situation in Gaza, following Israel’s three-month blockade of supplies into the besieged Strip. Under increasing pressure to lift the blockade on Gaza and allow essential supplies in, Israel has attempted to present a solution by distributing aid via the US-backed GHF. However, Jake Wood, a US military veteran overseeing the organisation, has already resigned, saying it would not be able to fulfil the principles of \"humanity, neutrality, impartiality, and independence\". The GHF “restricts aid to only one part of Gaza while leaving other dire needs unmet”, UN humanitarian chief Tom Fletcher said at the Security Council last week. “It makes aid conditional on political and military aims. It makes starvation a bargaining chip. It is a cynical sideshow. A deliberate distraction. A fig leaf for further violence and displacement.” The UN and other humanitarian organisations have refused to work with the GHF on the basis that it would compromise values and put their teams and those receiving aid at risk. They have said the GHF can be used by Israel to forcibly displace the population by requiring them to move near a few distribution hubs or else face starvation. The UN has also opposed the use of facial recognition to vet those receiving aid. How has Israel starved the people of Gaza? One in five Palestinians in the Gaza Strip is facing starvation because of Israel’s nearly three-month-long blockade of the Strip. The chaos at the distribution point underscores the staggering level of hunger gripping Gaza. According to the latest Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) report, 1.95 million people - 93 percent of the enclave’s population - are facing acute food shortages. Certain governorates are experiencing more severe levels of hunger, namely in North Gaza. The IPC says Israel’s continued blockade “would likely result in further mass displacement within and across governorates”, as items essential for people’s survival will be depleted.",

      "content": "Justin Raimondo article archives Justin Raimondo obituaries Justin Raimondo, former editorial director and co-founder of Antiwar.com, is dead at 67. He died at his home in Sebastopol, California, with his husband, Yoshinori Abe, by his side. He had been diagnosed with 4th stage lung cancer in October 2017. Justin co-founded Antiwar.com with Eric Garris in 1995. Under their leadership, Antiwar.com became a leading force against U.S. wars and foreign intervention, providing daily and often hourly updates and comprehensive news, analysis, and opinion on war and peace. Inspired by Justin’s spirit, vision, and energy, Antiwar.com will go on. Justin (born Dennis Raimondo, November 18, 1951) grew up in Yorktown Heights, New York and, as a teenager, became a libertarian. He was a fierce advocate of peace who hated war, and an early advocate of gay liberation. He wrote frequently for many different publications and authored several books. He was also politically active in both the Libertarian and Republican parties. The Young Rebel When Justin was six, he was, in his own words, “a wild child.” This will surprise no one who knows him. In “Cold War Comfort,” which he wrote for Chronicles Magazine, he tells how he dashed out of his first-grade class with his teacher chasing him. Because this was a daily occurrence, he writes, he was sent to a prominent New York psychiatrist named Dr. Robert Soblen. Just this decade, Justin got his hands on Soblen’s notes on his case and learned that Soblen had concluded that Justin was schizophrenic. Soblen’s reason? Justin was Catholic, claimed to have seen the Virgin Mary, and believed in miracles. Soblen recommended locking up young Justin in a state mental institution. The one Soblen had in mind was Rockland State Hospital, which, according to Justin, was the backdrop for the movie The Snake Pit. Soblen was not just a psychiatrist. He was also a top Soviet spy and friend of Stalin who was tasked with infiltrating the American Trotskyist movement. He was ultimately convicted of espionage and sentenced to life imprisonment in 1961. Ultimately, in 1962, Soblen committed suicide after jumping bail, fleeing to Israel, and seeking asylum in the UK. When Justin was 14 years old, he wrote an article on Objectivism, Ayn Rand’s philosophy, for a local New York newspaper. Rand’s lawyer, Henry Holzer, responded by sending him a “cease and desist” letter. Not long after, Justin went to a lecture at the Nathaniel Branden Institute and stood in line to get a book signed. He was identified, pulled out of line, and escorted to a private room. Soon Nathaniel Branden came in and gave Justin a resounding lecture. Shortly after this, Ayn Rand herself entered the room with her entourage. According to Justin, she seemed surprised that he was so young. When Justin told her that the editors of his piece had edited it and changed some of his meaning. Rand warmed up and said, “So you want to be a writer.” As an Objectivist and budding libertarian, Justin participated in the student strike at his progressive high school, Cherrylawn, in 1968. Although exuberantly popular with students and quite a real-life experiment in anarcho-libertarianism, the school ultimately reverted to its more traditional mode of, among other things, decision making. No more collective morning meetings of students to decide what they would or would not study that day, and whose classes they would attend! Shortly after graduating from high school, Justin made the leap to San Francisco. Here Justin found a place he made his own and remained for nearly 40 years. The Activist Justin was very active politically from an early age. In the mid to late 1970s, he worked to get the Libertarian Party to accept gay rights and was a participant in the gay liberation movement in San Francisco. Justin was one of the activists who spoke out strongly against the Dan White verdict. White was found guilty of manslaughter and given a 7-year prison sentence for killing San Francisco mayor George Moscone and Supervisor Harvey Milk, two prominent gay rights advocates. Justin thought that White should have been found guilty of first-degree murder. His powerful booklet about the case, In Praise of Outlaws, was published by the Students for a Libertarian Society. Justin Co-founded the Libertarian Party Radical Caucus (LPRC) in late 1978. Economist Murray Rothbard joined a few months later. Around the same time, Justin became one of the first employees of the newly formed Students for a Libertarian Society. Shortly after Democratic US Senator Sam Nunn and other members of Congress moved to reinstate the military draft and draft registration, Justin helped organize a number of anti-draft rallies that were held around the country on May 1, 1979. The LPRC disbanded in 1983. Known for gay rights activism and radicalizing the Libertarian Party, Justin nevertheless did not for the most part identify with the left. He found more intellectual inspiration in the Old Right, people like John T. Flynn, Albert J. Nock, Frank Chodorov, Isabel Paterson, and other mid-20th century figures who defended the vision of a constitutional republic and protested the progressive leviathan’s despotic powers at home and abroad. Justin was especially influenced by novelist Garet Garrett, who saw Franklin Roosevelt’s presidency as a revolutionary development that gutted American freedom while leaving the superficial form of the Constitution intact, and who was perhaps “even harsher” in opposing Truman’s Cold War imperialism. Justin regarded the irreconcilable conflict between interventionists and traditionalists as the defining struggle over the heart and soul of American conservatism. Justin long hoped that electoral politics could restore anti-imperialism on the right. In 1987, Justin and his friends Eric Garris, Colin Hunter, and Alexia Gilmore started the Libertarian Republican Organizing Committee within the Republican Party. It was a predecessor to the Libertarian Republican faction within the Republican Party that was led by then-Congressman Ron Paul. Not content just to write and organize, in 1996, Justin ran as a Republican against powerful Bay Area Congresswoman Nancy Pelosi. In his campaign, he emphasized his opposition to her vote in favor of the Clinton Administration’s military intervention in Bosnia. Because of his strong antiwar views, Justin also supported Pat Buchanan three times in his run for President of the United States: 1992, 1996, and 2000. In 2000, Justin gave the nominating speech for Pat Buchanan at the Reform Party convention in Long Beach. It can be seen here from 1:19:00 to 1:32:02. A Writer to the End Ayn Rand correctly intuited Justin’s path. Although at times a dedicated activist, he primarily fought the power through writing. Justin wrote regularly for the Los Angeles Times, Huffington Post, and the American Conservative. He also wrote for Reason, Mises Review, the Journal of Libertarian Studies, Libertarian Review, the San Francisco Chronicle, The Spectator, Real Clear Politics, and Mother Jones. For several years, he also had a monthly column for Chronicles Magazine. His two most important books were his 1993 Reclaiming the American Right: The Lost Legacy of the Conservative Movement, published by the Center for Libertarian Studies and reissued in 2008 by the Intercollegiate Studies Institute with a Foreword by Pat Buchanan and an introduction by George W. Carey, and his 2000 biography, An Enemy of the State: The Life of Murray N. Rothbard, published by Prometheus Books. Of course, his most prolific writing was for Antiwar.com. He, along with managing editor Eric Garris, helped set up Antiwar.com in 1995 and he was writing a column 7 days a week by 1999, when Antiwar.com became a major force on the World Wide Web, going viral when it led nationwide opposition to the NATO bombing of Serbia and Kosovo. Justin was the guiding light of Antiwar.com and over those 20 years wrote about 3,000 articles. Largely due to Justin’s columns, Antiwar.com continued to grow in focus and influence after September 11, 2001, and established itself as a leader of opposition to the new wars of the 21st Century. Justin led the charge in stressing the need for libertarians, peace activists, and all Americans to resist the war machine, starting with the Afghanistan intervention. His writing on Antiwar.com got him on cable news during the run-up to the 2003 US invasion of Iraq: he appeared multiple times on Fox News Channel, CNN, and MSNBC. His outspoken views made him a target of various pro-war intellectuals, notably Bill Kristol, David Horowitz, and Christopher Hitchens. As the nation went to war and throughout the years of conflict, Justin did not tire in his opposition. No writer more relentlessly and meticulously documented the crimes of the war party. Pursuing the American Dream Justin fondly quoted poet Robinson Jeffers, who described America as a “perishing republic.” But Justin never gave up on the country he loved, and in his later years he found his own piece of the American dream. In 2007 Justin moved from San Francisco up north to Sonoma County, where he embraced life as a curmudgeonly semi-gentleman-farmer. He took immense pleasure in cutting his lawn, chatting with the neighbors, and surveying the horse pastures beyond the wooden fences across the road, all the while assiduously following political and cultural events, largely via the internet. Although early on he was skeptical of gay marriage, Justin defended the right of gays to marry, and married his longtime companion, Yoshinori Abe, in 2017. When Justin was diagnosed with Stage 4 lung cancer in October 2017, he was told he had at most 6 months to live. But he was an early user of Keytruda, which likely increased his lifespan by over one year. One of the last pleasures Justin had as part of his Antiwar.com activities was seeing, on June 12, three judges of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, in 18-15416 Dennis Raimondo v. FBI, roundly rebuke the pathetic Department of Justice lawyer who claimed that the court should have no say in how the FBI held on to evidence when it was clear that no crime was committed. On Thursday, June 27, Justin finally succumbed to his cancer. He is survived by his two sisters, Dale and Diane, and his husband Yoshi. Justin was one of a kind. He will be missed, both here at Antiwar.com and by the wider world.",

      "content": "The last vice president to serve during wartime was also the last president to have done so: George H.W. Bush (1924-2018). Bush’s presidency, unlike that of his son’s, was marked, mainly, by a prudential approach to foreign affairs. Bush’s warning about the dangers of unleashing the demons of “suicidal nationalism based upon ethnic hatred” in post-Soviet countries such as Ukraine went, alas, unheeded. Yet the administration of Bush I was also the last, perhaps until now, that understood that a mature power, as the columnist and grand strategist Walter Lippmann (1889-1974) pointed out, …will make measured and limited use of its power. It will eschew the theory of global and universal duty which not only commits it to unending wars of intervention but intoxicated its thinking with the illusion that it is a crusader for righteousness.” Lippmann would have scorned the bipartisan fantasies of global omnipotence that came into vogue in the decades following Bush’s presidency. What in retrospect appear to be faddish, if not absurd, texts from the 1990’s, such as Francis Fukuyama’s ‘End of History’; Charles Krauthammer’s ‘The Unipolar Moment’; and Paul Wolfowitz’s draft of the 1992 Defense planning guidance (later popularized as the ‘Wolfowitz Doctrine’), served as the intellectual basis for the disastrous series of wars that were to follow. As it happens, Vice President JD Vance is the first sitting vice president since George HW Bush to serve during wartime. And at a commencement speech at the US Naval Academy’s 2025 Commissioning Ceremony, Vance delivered a coup de grace to the outdated yet still dangerous notions of American unipolarity that have animated US foreign policy for the past thirty plus years. It is for that reason that the speech was largely ignored by a media ecosystem that remains very much in thrall to the ideas and concepts that have resulted in upwards of a million deaths worldwide since 9/11 (for a breakdown of the damage done by the series of wars launched by George W. Bush and his successors, see Brown University’s Cost of War Project.) Vance reminded the midshipmen that, …We had a long experiment in our foreign policy that traded national defense and the maintenance of our alliances for nation building and meddling in foreign countries affairs, even when those foreign countries had very little to do with core American interests. Taking aim at the aforementioned theories of American primacy from the 1990s, Vance noted that, …Following the collapse of the Soviet Union, our policymakers assumed that American primacy on the world stage was guaranteed. For a brief time, we were a superpower without any peer, nor did we believe any foreign nation could possibly rise to compete with the United States of America. So our leaders traded hard power for soft power. We stopped making things, everything from cars to computers to the weapons of war, like the ships that guard our waters and the weapons that you will use in the future. Why do we do that? Well, too many of us believe that economic integration would naturally lead to peace by making countries like the People’s Republic of China more like the United States. Over time, we were told the world would converge toward a uniform set of bland, secular, universal ideals, regardless of culture or country, and those that didn’t want to converge, well, our policy makers would make it their goal to force them by any means necessary. About the strategy (or lack thereof) of the Bush-Cheney foreign policy, Vance observed that, …Our leaders pursued what they assumed would be easy jobs for the world’s preeminent superpower. ‘How hard could it be to build a few democracies in the Middle East?’ Well, almost impossibly hard, it turns out, and unbelievably costly. And it wasn’t our politicians that bore the consequences of such a profound miscalculation; it was the American people, to the tune of trillions of dollars. But more than anyone, it was born by the people who were in your shoes, just a few short years ago, by our service members and their families. Vance told the assembled that those days are over. “I want to be clear,” he said. “The Trump administration has reversed course. No more undefined missions, no more open ended conflicts. We’re returning to a strategy grounded in realism and protecting our core national interests.” Lippmann himself couldn’t have said it better. James W. Carden is the editor of The Realist Review. He is a columnist and former adviser to the US-Russia Bilateral Presidential Commission at the U.S. Department of State.

      "content": "BANGKOK (AP) — The army chiefs of Thailand and Cambodia agreed on Thursday to a withdrawal and to seek a peaceful solution to the disputed border area where a brief clash a day earlier killed one Cambodian soldier, Thai officials said. Cambodian troops were conducting a routine patrol along the border when the Thai side opened fire, Cambodia said Wednesday. The Thai army said that the Cambodian soldiers entered a disputed area and opened fire when Thai soldiers approached to negotiate. The clash lasted about 10 minutes until local commanders spoke to each other and ordered a ceasefire, the Thai army said. Gen. Pana Claewplodtook, the Thai army chief, met with Cambodian counterpart Gen. Mao Sophan at a border checkpoint and expressed his condolences over the death of the Cambodian soldier, Thai army spokesperson Winthai Suvaree said. Winthai said both sides agreed to a withdrawal and will seek peaceful solutions together through special joint committees on border situations between the two countries in the coming weeks. He said that the troops from both sides had already stepped back from the area of the clash to their usual positions. A statement from the Cambodian army that was released later said that the two countries would work together to resolve the situation peacefully. However, the statement said that Cambodia wouldn’t “retreat or stand unarmed at the point of conflict,” although it wasn’t clear from which position the army was referring to. Thai Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra said on Thursday before the talks that she was confident of a positive development for the border situation, and that both sides agreed that they don’t wish for violence. Prime Minister Hun Manet of Cambodia posted on his Facebook that officials of the two countries wanted to prevent further clashes and normalize the situation. But he also said Cambodia has sent troops and weapons as reinforcement to the disputed border. “I do not want to see any fighting between armies that does not bring any benefits to our two countries and peoples, especially those who are fighting directly on the front lines,” he said. Neighboring Thailand and Cambodia have a long history of land disputes. The most prominent involved the Preah Vihear promontory, an area around a 1,000-year-old temple that was listed as a UNESCO world heritage site in 2008. The U.N.’s International Court of Justice granted sovereignty over the area to Cambodia in 2013. There have been recent border incidents between the two countries, including in February when Cambodian troops and their family members entered an ancient temple along the border and sang the Cambodian national anthem, leading to a brief argument with Thai troops. ___ Sopheng Cheang reported from Phnom Penh, Cambodia.",

      "content": "London - The controversial U.S.- and Israel-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), whose operations got off to a chaotic start this week in the war-torn Palestinian territory, says it is winding down its Swiss operation after three months. The move comes as Swiss authorities said GHF was breaching rules for foundations registered in that country. GHF told CBS News that moving forward, its only operations would be based out of the United States. The legal complication for GHF in Switzerland emerged as the Hamas-run Gaza Ministry of Health said one Palestinian was killed and 47 others were wounded when Israeli forces fired shots as people were seeking food at one of its aid distribution hubs in southern Gaza on Tuesday. The Israel Defense Forces said in a statement Tuesday that troops had only fired \"warning shots\" to restore order at the site. GHF later said in a statement that \"no shots were fired at Palestinian crowds\" and \"there were no casualties.\" Some injured Palestinians could be seen in video footage of the incident verified by CBS News Confirmed, which showed hundreds of people around the distribution center. Little has been made public about GHF, including who funds it. CBS News has been told by one source that GHF has employed at least 300 American contractors, all heavily armed, who have been given \"as much ammunition as they can carry.\" The Gaza Humanitarian Foundation said, according to a document obtained by CBS News that appears to have been written by the group, that it was registering in both Delaware and Geneva, Switzerland. The Swiss \"affiliate\" was established in order to \"address donors who would prefer to participate outside of the U.S. structure,\" the document says. \"The Swiss GHF Board and Executive team will closely mirror that of the U.S. GHF and will adhere to the same principles, mission and values,\" says the document. A separate document seeking to register the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation in Switzerland, dated Jan. 31, 2025, was published as part of the country's commercial register. The foundation is shown as being registered from Feb. 12. According to the Swiss registration document, \"the foundation pursues exclusively charitable and philanthropic objectives for the benefit of people in need of support for material, psychological or health reasons, and more specifically to provide humanitarian aid to those affected by the conflict in the Gaza Strip, including the secure provision of food, water, medicine, shelter and reconstruction.\" Displaced Palestinians receive food packages from GHF, a U.S.-backed foundation distributing humanitarian aid, in western Rafah, in the southern Gaza Strip, on May 27, 2025. AFP via Getty Images It lists three individuals as leaders of the Swiss foundation: David Papazian, who the document says is from Armenia but based in the U.K.; Lolk Samuel Marcel Henderson, an American in Arlington, Virginia; and David Kohler, from Switzerland. Subsequent documents, dated May 19 and May 23 respectively, announced the removal of Swiss national Kohler from the board of the foundation, and then the end of Swiss accounting firm OGH Expertises Comptables et Fiscales SA's role as an auditor of the foundation. Switzerland's Federal Supervisory Authority for Foundations, known as the ESA, told CBS News on Wednesday that, according to its assessment, the Swiss branch of the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation is \"currently not fulfilling various legal obligations,\" in the country. The ESA said the aid group's Swiss branch does not have the required signatory member of its board resident in Switzerland, that it doesn't have the minimum three board members required by Swiss statutes, and that it did not appear to have a Swiss bank account, a valid Swiss address, or an auditor — all of which are requirements for foundations like GHF which are registered in the country. \"Based on this information, the ESA assumes that the Swiss foundation has not yet commenced its activities and is therefore inactive,\" the authority told CBS News. \"The ESA has informed the foundation of its legal requirements and requested that it clarify the situation. The necessary clarifications are currently under way.\" A Swiss non-governmental watchdog organization, TRIAL International, said it had filed two legal submissions to the Swiss government on May 20 and 21, with the Federal Supervisory Authority for Foundations and the Federal Department of Foreign Affairs, seeking to assess GHF's compliance with the Swiss legal system, as well as with Switzerland's Federal Act on Private Security Services Provided Abroad. The legal submissions were \"intended to urgently remedy potential breaches by the GHF of various rules of national and international law, in particular concerning 'private security services' within the framework of the foundation's activities, such as the militarized security of distribution points and the control of individuals,\" the NGO said in a statement. Switzerland \"has a moral but also a particular legal obligation to make sure that entities operating from its territory, themselves, respect the Geneva Conventions. That's enshrined in the first article of the Geneva Conventions,\" TRIAL International director Philip Grant told CBS News. \"So we just wanted to understand what they did\" through the Swiss entity, he said. Grant said it was unclear how much GHF activity had actually taken place in Geneva, which was part of the motivation for his group's submissions. It was also looking to find out whether GHF had requested and received necessary approvals to engage private military services, the use of which is tightly regulated under Swiss law for organizations registered in the country. In response to CBS News' request for clarity, GHF said Wednesday that \"the only GHF entity that is in use today is the foundation established in the United States by Loik Henderson in February 2025. That is the only entity through which GHF is operating and will operate moving forward. Swiss entity was created as a contingency; is not operational; and is being wound down.\" James Smith, a doctor who has worked inside Gaza, told CBS News that both the presence of armed contractors at aid distribution centers and the locations of GHF's hubs in the south of Gaza raise red flags for humanitarian workers. He said the location of the hubs could potentially serve as a way to forcibly displace the population of Gaza to the south of the Strip. \"They are undignified. They are inhumane. We've seen people being corralled into cages in the baking heat,\" Smith said. Smith pointed out concerns raised by the United Nations, which has declined to work with the organization, about the methods of GHF and even \"some of the people that, until the last couple of days, worked for GHF and have since resigned, saying that they cannot adhere to the humanitarian principles if they continue to work for this entity.\" \"The risks posed by armed military actors, particularly those who are parties to a conflict, also providing humanitarian assistance should be and has been roundly condemned and is not something that any reputable humanitarian organization, academic of humanitarianism or humanitarian practitioner should ever support,\" Smith said. contributed to this report.",

      "content": "Ireland's Tanaiste, or deputy prime minister, Simon Harris, defended the government's position on Thursday that Israel is carrying out a genocide in Gaza, Irish broadcaster RTE reported. “We are the first government in the European Union (EU) to say what Israel is doing is genocide. It is genocide,\" Harris told an opposition lawmaker during a heated exchange in parliament, known as the the Dáil. Catherine Connolly, an independent, accused the government of not doing enough to punish Israel for its 19-month-long war on Gaza, which has killed more than 54,000 Palestinians, more than half of them women and children, according to the Palestinian health ministry. “I’m disgusted and sickened, sickened - watching children dying on our television screens and every day I come to work, and work with all the people in here to do our best to show leadership at a time of horrific conflict,\" Harris said. New MEE newsletter: Jerusalem Dispatch Sign up to get the latest insights and analysis on Israel-Palestine, alongside Turkey Unpacked and other MEE newsletters “We’re working to support the people of Palestine and the only chamber I ever go into in the entire world where people don’t acknowledge that Ireland, the government, the people of Ireland, are standing with the people of Palestine, standing up for human rights, standing up for international law, is here when you get up and distort - with your ideology - the actions of this government.\" Ireland recognised Palestinian statehood one year ago, and in January, it joined South Africa's genocide case against Israel at the International Court of Justice (ICJ). On Thursday, Harris said that a bill banning trade with goods from Israeli settlements - deemed illegal under international law - would move to the foreign affairs committee next month, the Irish Times said. The government is also under pressure to help remove the Central Bank’s role in permitting the sale of Israel bonds in the EU, and to stop any flights over Ireland that may be carrying weapons to Israel, the paper reported. “I’m proud of the people of this country. I’m proud that we went into an election, and it didn’t matter what party you were in, you stood up and said, ‘We are going to support the people of Palestine’.\" Harris's stance was backed by the taoiseach - or prime minister, Micheal Martin, earlier in the week. “We have been very consistent in our support to the Palestinian people and their right to self-determination, and in condemning the war crimes and the genocide that is occurring right now,” Martin told the Dail. “The focus has to be relentlessly on the policies of Prime Minister Netanyahu and the Israeli government, made up of extreme far-right elements who are committing genocide in Gaza right now.\" In 2018, the Occupied Territories Bill was introduced in Ireland by Independent Senator Frances Black, proposing a ban on trade with businesses operating in illegal Israeli settlements on Palestinian land, but it was ultimately blocked over concerns about breaching EU trade rules. However, an advisory opinion from the ICJ in July marked a turning point in reconsidering the enactment of the Irish bill. The ICJ concluded that Israel's presence in the occupied Palestinian territories is \"unlawful” and the country should “end its presence in the occupied Palestinian territory as rapidly as possible”. More than 400 of Ireland’s senior legal academics and practising lawyers have called on the government to enact the bill in its original form, prohibiting all goods and services in the occupied West Bank, such as Airbnb.",

      "content": "Today is the 139th anniversary of Randolph Bourne’s birthday. Antiwar.com named its parent institute for this early 20th century antiwar activist. Read Jeff Riggenbach’s biography of Bourne. [Transcribed from the Libertarian Tradition podcast episode “Randolph Bourne (1886–1918)”] Randolph Bourne was an American intellectual journalist who flourished for a few years in the second decade of the 20th century – in the Teens, the decade that ran from 1910 to 1920. Bourne wrote mostly for magazines during this period. His byline was particularly familiar to readers of The New Republic – until his radically antiwar views on the eve of the US government’s intervention in World War I got him fired. He moved over to The Seven Arts, a newly launched magazine with a smaller circulation than The New Republic and one less well suited to Bourne’s particular talents and interests, since its primary focus was the arts, rather than social and political issues. He was able to publish only six antiwar articles in The Seven Arts before its doors were closed by an owner fearful of the Wilson administration and its Sedition Act of 1918, which made it a crime to criticize the Constitution, the government, the military, or the flag. Only a few months after The Seven Arts ceased publication, Randolph Bourne died, a victim of the flu epidemic that killed more than 25 million people in 1918 and 1919, nearly a million of them in the United States. That was 1 percent of the population 90 years ago. One percent of the present US population would be more than 3 million Americans. Imagine what it would be like to live through a flu epidemic that killed more than 3 million people in the space of little more than a year. That’s what it was like for Americans living 90 years ago, at the end of World War I. Most of the people that flu virus killed have long been forgotten – except, of course, by members of their own families. But Randolph Bourne has not been forgotten, not completely. People are still reading his work. They’re still talking about his ideas and about his memorable phrases. The most famous of these has gradually become so widely quoted in our culture that millions of people have heard it, even heard it repeatedly, without ever learning who originally wrote or said it: “War is the health of the State.” Randolph Silliman Bourne first emerged into the light of day on May 30, 1886 in Bloomfield, New Jersey, a small town fewer than 20 miles from Manhattan. His family was comfortably middle-class, and he was the grandson of a respected Congregational minister. But he seems to have been born unlucky all the same. First, his head and face were deformed at birth in a bungled forceps delivery. Then, at the age of four, after a battle with spinal tuberculosis, he became a hunchback. Then, when he was seven, his parents lost everything in the Panic of 1893, and he and his mother were abandoned by his father and left to live in genteel poverty on the charity of his mother’s prosperous (if somewhat tightfisted) brother. Meanwhile, his growth had been permanently stunted by the spinal tuberculosis of a few years before, so that by the time he graduated from high school at the age of 17, in 1903, he had attained his full adult height of five feet. Bourne was an exemplary student. His academic record in high school earned him a place in the class of 1907 at Princeton, but by the time he was supposed to appear on campus to register for classes in the fall of 1903, it was evident that he couldn’t afford to attend. He could barely afford books. He was flat broke. And his mother needed his financial help if she was going to go on living the decent, middle-class lifestyle to which she had become accustomed. So Bourne postponed college and went to work. He knew his way around a piano, so for the next six years he worked as a piano teacher, a piano tuner, and a piano player (accompanying singers in a recording studio in Carnegie Hall). He also cut piano rolls. On the side he freelanced for book publishers as a proofreader. Now and then, when musical work was harder to find, he did secretarial work. By 1909, when he was 23 years old, Bourne had saved enough to cut back on his working hours and try to catch up on the college experience he’d been putting off. He enrolled at Columbia, where he fell under the sway of historian and political scientist Charles Beard and philosopher John Dewey, and began publishing essays in the Dial, the Atlantic Monthly, and other magazines. His first book, Youth and Life, a collection of his magazine essays, was published the year he graduated from Columbia, 1913. And that fall, the now 27-year-old Bourne set out for Europe. In his senior year he had been awarded the Gilder Fellowship for travel abroad, which the historian Louis Filler has called “Columbia’s most distinguished honor” during that period. Bourne spent a year travelling around Europe and pursuing such independent study as interested him. Then, in August 1914, he returned to America, took up residence in Greenwich Village, and resumed writing for the Dial and the Atlantic Monthly, along with a new, upstart weekly called The New Republic. Actually, it might be more accurate to say that Bourne fled Europe in August 1914 than to say that he merely “returned to America” at that time. For it was in late July and early August of 1914 that Europe – virtually all of Europe – embarked upon the conflict we know today as World War I. Bourne opposed this conflict, and he was especially worried that his own country, the United States, would choose to enter it before long. Bourne wrote about many subjects over the next four years; he wrote enough about education, for example, that he was able to fill two books with his magazine pieces on the subject – The Gary Schools in 1916 and Education and Living in 1917. But his main subject during the last four years of his life was the new world war and the urgent need that the United States stay out of it. Bourne made few friends by adopting this stance. It brought him, as the journalist Ben Reiner later put it, “into sharp conflict with the rising pro-war hysteria that preceded America’s entry into World War I.” In the view of yet another journalistic commentator, Christopher Phelps, few 20th-century American dissenters have… suffered the wrath of their targets as greatly as Bourne did. By 1917, The New Republic stopped publishing his political pieces. The Seven Arts … collapsed when its financial angel refused further support because of Bourne’s antiwar articles. According to Reiner, the problem was that once Bourne’s “biting attacks on government repression began to appear in The Seven Arts,” this gave “birth to rumors that the publisher… was supporting a pro-German magazine. She… withdrew her support, which closed the magazine down.” Nor was the demise of The Seven Arts the end of the punishment Bourne had to bear for speaking his mind. Phelps notes that “even at the Dial… he was stripped from editorial power in 1918 – the result of an uncharacteristically underhanded intervention by his former mentor John Dewey, one of the objects of Bourne’s disillusioned antiwar pen.” Phelps quotes a letter Bourne sent to a friend shortly thereafter, in which he laments that “I feel very much secluded from the world, very much out of touch with my times. … The magazines I write for die violent deaths, and all my thoughts are unprintable.” The historian Robert Westbrook put the matter as memorably and eloquently as anyone when he said in 2004 that “Bourne disturbed the peace of John Dewey and other intellectuals supporting Woodrow Wilson’s crusade to make the world safe for democracy, and they made him pay for it.” Yet the ruination of his career was far from the only price he had to pay. Westbrook quotes John Dos Passos’s claim, from his novel 1919, that, in addition to his professional setbacks, “friends didn’t like to be seen with Bourne,” and that “his father” – who had walked out of his life a quarter-century before – “wrote him begging him not to disgrace the family name.” A few weeks later, he was dead. Several friends, going through his apartment after his death, found an unpublished manuscript in the wastebasket next to his desk. It was entitled “The State.” “War is the health of the State,” Randolph Bourne wrote in that discarded essay, which he probably died believing would never see print, “and it is during war that one best understands the nature of that institution.” For it cannot be too firmly realized that war is … the chief function of States. … War cannot exist without a military establishment, and a military establishment cannot exist without a State organization. War has an immemorial tradition and heredity only because the State has a long tradition and heredity. But they are inseparably and functionally joined. Moreover, Bourne argued, it is not too much to say that the normal relation of States is war. Diplomacy is a disguised war, in which States seek to gain by barter and intrigue, by the cleverness of wits, the objectives which they would have to gain more clumsily by means of war. Diplomacy is used while the States are recuperating from conflicts in which they have exhausted themselves. It is the wheedling and the bargaining of the worn-out bullies as they rise from the ground and slowly restore their strength to begin fighting again. Randolph Bourne believed that informed citizens needed to realize the implications of what he was saying. For if the State’s chief function is war, then the State must suck out of the nation a large part of its energy for its purely sterile purposes of defense and aggression. It devotes to waste or to actual destruction as much as it can of the vitality of the nation. No one will deny that war is a vast complex of life-destroying and life-crippling forces. If the State’s chief function is war, then it is chiefly concerned with coordinating and developing the powers and techniques which make for destruction. And this means not only the actual and potential destruction of the enemy, but of the nation at home as well. For the … calling away of energy into military pursuits means a crippling of the productive and life-enhancing processes of the national life. Randolph Bourne believed that “we cannot crusade against war without crusading implicitly against the State. And we cannot expect … to end war, unless at the same time we take measures to end the State in its traditional form.” Bourne had reason to be wary when writing sentences like those in 1918. People were being imprisoned and, in some cases, deported for writing things like that. There was a particular prejudice against anarchists and against people who sounded as though they might be anarchists. Perhaps this is why Bourne added the following caveat to his call for ending the State: “The State is not the nation, and the State can be modified and even abolished in its present form, without harming the nation. On the contrary, with the passing of the dominance of the State, the genuine life-enhancing forces of the nation will be liberated.” Randolph Bourne was an idealist. He hoped for a world free of war, a world in which what he called “the productive and life-enhancing processes” were the dominant processes in our national life. It is appropriate, then, that in the Internet age, he is perhaps best known to the general public, not only for his immortal phrase “War is the health of the State,” but also as the namesake of a nonprofit foundation that runs a popular website. The nonprofit foundation is the Randolph Bourne Institute. And the website is Antiwar.com. The folks who run Antiwar.com would have us believe that their site should not be construed as libertarian in its essence. As Development Director Angela Keaton put it recently, “Antiwar.com is not a libertarian site. Antiwar.com is a foreign policy site operated by libertarians which seeks a broad based coalition in educating about the dangers of Empire.” I’m inclined to think Randolph Bourne cut through to the heart of the matter more effectively, however, when he wrote that “we cannot crusade against war without crusading implicitly against the State.” In effect, you can’t be consistently and intelligently antiwar, unless you’re libertarian. The folks at Antiwar.com are, of course, aware of this. They quote that very same sentence of Bourne’s on the “Who We Are” page on their website and state further that their own “dedication to libertarian principles” is “inspired in large part by the works and example of the late Murray N. Rothbard.” The work that’s being done 24/7 at Antiwar.com not only honors Randolph Bourne’s contribution to the libertarian tradition; it also helps to assure that that tradition will continue and grow.

      "content": "Saudi Arabia’s defense minister informed Iranian officials that failure to strike a nuclear agreement with the US could prompt an Israeli attack, multiple sources told Reuters. Washington and Tehran have struggled to reach a new deal since President Donald Trump scrapped the last pact in 2018. The “covert message” was relayed by the Saudi defense chief, Prince Khalid bin Salman, during a visit to Iran in mid-April, Reuters reported on Friday, citing two unnamed Iranian officials and two sources close to the government in Riyadh. Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian, Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi and armed forces Chief of Staff Mohammad Bagheri were all reportedly present for the meeting, which marked the first visit to Iran by a senior Saudi royal in nearly 30 years. According to the sources, bin Salman warned the Iranian leadership that US President Donald Trump had “little patience for drawn-out negotiations” and that the “window for diplomacy would close fast” if a deal was not reached “quickly.” He went on to raise “the possibility of an Israeli attack” should the talks break down, Reuters added. While the Fars News agency reported that Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Ismail Baghaei had contested the Reuters story in comments to journalists later on Friday, the outlet provided no additional details. The prospect of Israeli military action against Iran has been raised repeatedly throughout the ongoing nuclear talks with the US, with American officials telling the New York Times that they are concerned Tel Aviv could launch an attack with little notice. Though a US intelligence assessment questioned whether a unilateral Israeli strike would be effective, some Israeli officials have argued that Washington “would have no choice but to assist Israel militarily if Iran counterattacked,” the Times reported. Earlier this week, Trump said he had urged Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to hold off on such an attack, stating it “would be inappropriate to do right now because we’re very close to a solution” in the nuclear talks. “Now, that could change at any moment. It could change with a phone call. But right now, I think they want to make a deal. And, if we can make a deal, [it would] save a lot of lives,” Trump told reporters at the White House on Wednesday. However, the Trump administration has offered mixed messages about the ongoing negotiations, with the president at times threatening direct US military action against Tehran should the talks fail. Earlier this week, the president even argued that a revived nuclear deal must allow Washington to “go in with inspectors” at any time and “blow up whatever we want.” Though some US officials have insisted the Islamic Republic must completely dismantle its uranium enrichment program as part of any new deal – echoing Israel’s stance – Iran has categorically rejected that demand. On Thursday, Iran’s top diplomat said his country remained open to negotiations, but added that a fresh agreement must “fully terminate all sanctions and uphold Iran’s nuclear rights – including enrichment.” Will Porter is assistant news editor and book editor at the Libertarian Institute, and a regular contributor at Antiwar.com.

      "content": "Smotrich and Katz said that approving the 22 settlements will prevent a Palestinian state Israel has approved the establishment of 22 Jewish settlements in the Israeli-occupied West Bank as it continues its policy of the de facto annexation of the Palestinian territory. Peace Now, an Israeli settlement watchdog, said the approval marks the biggest expansion of settlements in the West Bank in more than 30 years since the Oslo Accords were signed in 1993. “The Israeli government no longer pretends otherwise: the annexation of the Occupied Territories and expansion of settlements is its central goal,” Peace Now said in a statement. New buildings stand around the Israeli settlement Ateret near the Palestinian village of Um Safa near Ramallah, in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, March 11, 2025. REUTERS/Mohammed Torokman “The cabinet’s decision to establish 22 new settlements—the most extensive move of its kind since the Oslo Accords, under which Israel committed not to establish new settlements—will dramatically reshape the West Bank and entrench the occupation even further,” Peace Now added. The new settlements were announced by Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz and Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, who said explicitly that the step would prevent the establishment of a Palestinian state. “All the new communities are being established with a long-term strategic vision, aimed at reinforcing Israeli control of the territory, preventing the establishment of a Palestinian state, and securing development reserves for settlement in the coming decades,” the ministers said. Some of the settlements that were approved were already constructed as outposts without government approval, and others will be new. Settlements in the occupied Palestinian territory are considered illegal under international law. The approval comes as Israeli settlers, emboldened by the government, have stepped up their attacks and intimidation tactics against Palestinians with the goal of stealing their land. Violent settlers recently forced 150 Palestinians to flee their village under the watch of the Israeli military. The Israeli military has also been engaged in a military campaign in the northern West Bank, which has destroyed refugee camps and displaced tens of thousands of Palestinians. Since October 7, 2023, at least 938 Palestinians, including 198 children, have been killed by Israeli forces and settlers in the West Bank.",

      "content": "Winter has often proven an indispensable ally of Mother Russia. The impending winter of 1812-13 forced Napoleon's withdrawal from Moscow, a retreat from which his Grande Armee never recovered. The winter of 1941-42 sealed the ultimate fate of the invading armies of Adolf Hitler's Third Reich. Vladimir Putin's new strategy in the war he launched on Ukraine in February is to conscript the coming winter of 2022-23 as an ally of his failing army. For weeks, there have been reports of Russian air, missile and drone strikes on power plants in every major Ukrainian city. The false report that a Russian-fired rocket had landed in Poland, killing two civilians, came on a day when 100 Russian bombs, rockets, missiles and drones hit \"infrastructure\" targets across Ukraine. It was the heaviest Russian barrage to date in the nine-month war. Putin's goal: As the Ukrainian army battles the Russian army in the Donbas and Kherson, the power grid upon which the Ukrainian nation and people depend is to be systematically attacked, shut down, destroyed. Without electric power, there will be no light or heat in Ukrainian homes, hospitals, offices or schools. Without electricity, food cannot be preserved, stoves do not work, water cannot be pumped. Without power, light and heat, Putin's expectation is that the Ukrainian people, who have patriotically supported their army, will, in the tens of thousands this winter, be at risk of freezing to death in the dark. Winter, from mid-December to mid-March, is the coldest and darkest of the seasons, and it begins in four weeks. On Friday, CNN reported that, after the latest wave of Russian strikes, 10 million Ukrainians, a fourth of the nation, were without power. \"Russia is turning winter into a weapon, even as its soldiers flail on the battlefield,\" wrote The New York Times on Sunday. \"In a relentless and intensifying barrage of missiles fired from ships at sea, batteries on land and planes in the sky, Moscow is destroying Ukraine's critical infrastructure, depriving millions of heat, light and clean water.\" Ukraine's state energy company adds: \"Due to a dramatic drop in temperature, electricity consumption is increasing daily in those regions of Ukraine where power supply has already been restored after massive missile strikes on November 15 on the energy infrastructure.\" The U.S. stance in this war is that the fighting stops and peace talks begin only when Kyiv says the fighting stops and the negotiations begin. But Americans, whose support for Ukraine has been indispensable in this war, also need to have a voice in when the war ends. For us, the greatest stake in this Russia-Ukraine war is not who ends up in control of Luhansk, Donetsk or Kherson, but that we not be drawn into a military conflict that would put us on the escalator to a war with Russia, a world war and perhaps a nuclear war. Nothing in Eastern or Central Europe is worth a major U.S. war with Russia that could go nuclear and cost millions of American lives. The Donbas and Crimea may be of great importance to Kyiv and Moscow, but nothing in these lands would justify a U.S. war with a nuclear-armed Russia, the kind of war we managed to avoid through the Cold War from 1949-1989. The recent incident of the S-300 surface-to-air missile misfired by Ukrainian forces, which landed several kilometers inside Poland, killing two Polish citizens, is a case in point. Hawkish cries for NATO retaliation against Russia, under Article 5 of the NATO treaty, revealed that America's War Party is still very much with us and eager for the next confrontation with Putin's Russia. In the final days of this lame-duck Congress, before control of the House passes to Republicans in January, Democrats are expected to approve Joe Biden's request for another $38 billion for the Kyiv regime, its army and its war. Passage of this legislation would virtually guarantee that the U.S. continues to finance this war and extend the fighting until spring. Why would we do this? The U.S. ought not dictate to Kyiv when it should move to the negotiating track to end this war. But we Americans do have, given our indispensable contributions to the Ukrainian war effort, the right to tell Kyiv when we believe that the risks of further fighting exceed any potential gain for us; and, if Kyiv is determined to fight on, to give notice that Ukraine will be doing so without any more U.S. munitions. Great powers should never cede to lesser powers, unconnected to their vital interests, the capacity to drag them into unwanted wars. The Polish missile incident, and the noisy clamor that arose for retaliation against Russia for hitting a NATO country, exposed the risks inherent in our many treaty commitments, where we are obliged to go to war for scores of nations, most of which are not remotely related to the security or vital interests of the United States.",

      "content": "It Took 24 Hours to Speak the Names of 12,000 Children Israel Killed in Gaza – A Fraction of the Total The vigil at Harvard University took place as UNICEF said that at least 50,000 Palestinian children have been killed or wounded in Gaza during 600 days of Israeli bombs, bullets, and blockades. Community members concluded a 24-hour vigil at Harvard University on Wednesday during which the names of almost 12,000 children slain in Gaza by Israeli forces were read aloud, signifying only a partial list of child casualties documented by the United Nations Children’s Fund, which found that at least 50,000 Palestinian children have been killed or wounded in the embattled enclave during 600 days of U.S.-backed genocidal slaughter. They All Have Names – a coalition of parents, educators, students, healthcare workers, faith leaders, and other community members – gathered at Harvard Square in Cambridge, Massachusetts to hold the vigil ahead of Harvard University’s commencement ceremonies on Thursday. According to the Harvard branch of Students for Justice in Palestine, it took nearly an hour-and-a-half just to read the names of infants killed by Israeli forces since October 7, 2023. Victims’ names were read in ascending order of their ages. “At least 17,400 children have been killed in Gaza since October 7,” said Dr. Lara Jirmanus a family physician and clinical instructor at Harvard Medical School. “They include at least 825 babies who could not celebrate their first birthday; 895 one-year olds; 3,266 preschoolers; 4,032 between the ages of 6 and 10; 3,646 middle schoolers; and 2,949 teenagers.” Faculty, staff, and community members have held vigil at Harvard Square in support of Gaza, reading the names of Palestinian children killed by ‘Israel’ since October 2023. pic.twitter.com/96BZWdtjEM — Kuffiya (@Kuffiyateam) May 28, 2025 “We gather today to remember them, their hopes, and dreams,” Jirmanus added. “And to remember that we have the power to stop this unspeakable catastrophe, by demanding our elected officials stop sending arms for genocide.” The vigil occurred against a backdrop of continued genocide denial and aspersions of casualty data provided by the Gaza Health Ministry – figures that Israeli military officials have repeatedly found to be accurate, and that peer-reviewed research published in The Lancet, one of the world’s preeminent medical journals, has determined to likely be a vast undercount. Jirmanus told Common Dreams that the names of around 12,000 children killed in Gaza between October 2023 and October 2024 were recited during the vigil at a rate of about 500 names per hour. As the vigil took place, the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF)—which has called Gaza “the world’s most dangerous place to be a child” – announced its latest estimate that 50,000 Palestinian children have been killed or injured in Gaza since Israel began attacking and besieging the strip in retaliation for the Hamas-led attack of October 7, 2023. All told, the Gaza Health Ministry says that at least 191,285 Palestinians have been killed or wounded by Israeli forces, including upward of 14,000 people who are missing and believed to be dead and buried beneath rubble of hundreds of thousands of bombed buildings. Among those maimed by Israel’s onslaught are thousands of children who have had one or more limbs amputated, often without anesthesia due to the Israeli blockade. Many surviving Palestinian children have also lost one or both parents. Some have lost their entire families. A new acronym has even been coined to describe some of these orphans: WCNSF, or “wounded child, no surviving family.” “In a 72-hour period this weekend, images from two horrific attacks provide yet more evidence of the unconscionable cost of this ruthless war on children in the Gaza Strip,” UNICEF Regional Director for the Middle East and North Africa Edouard Beigbeder said in a statement. “On Friday, we saw videos of the bodies of burnt, dismembered children from the al-Najjar family being pulled from the rubble of their home in Khan Younis,” Beigbeder noted. “Of 10 siblings under 12 years old, only one reportedly survived, with critical injuries.” “Early Monday, we saw images of a small child trapped in a burning school in Gaza City. That attack, in the early hours of the morning, reportedly killed at least 31 people, including 18 children,” he continued.

Secretary-General António Guterres for the first time added Israel to his so-called “List of Shame” of countries that kill and injure children during wars and other armed conflicts. The Harvard vigil took place as Israeli occupation forces pressed ahead with Operation Gideon’s Chariots, a campaign of conquest, indefinite occupation, and ethnic cleansing of Palestinians from Gaza to make way for new Israeli settlements. They All Have Names noted: Conditions in Gaza are more catastrophic than ever, as Israel has blocked humanitarian aid for nearly three months, only recently allowing a few trucks of aid, which the U.N. warned was “nowhere near enough.” Using starvation as a weapon of war is a war crime. Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, Doctors without Borders, and an independent U.N. commission have all concluded that Israel is committing genocide in Gaza. As officials in Gaza report hundreds of deaths—mostly of children and elders—from malnutrition and lack of medical care, even Israeli officials are speaking out against what former Prime Minister Ehud Olmert recently called a “war of extermination.” Extermination and forced starvation are among the alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity for which current Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is wanted by the International Criminal Court in The Hague. The other Hague-based global tribunal, the International Court of Justice, is currently weighing a genocide case against Israel brought by South Africa and backed by dozens of countries, either individually or as members of regional blocs. The 24-hour vigil also took place as U.S. President Donald Trump and his Republican administration – which continues to offer billions of dollars in arms as well as diplomatic support for Israel even as it acknowledges the mass starvation Gaza – wage a rhetorical and financial war against Harvard. While the administration claims its moves to strip Harvard of federal funding and contracts and block international students from attending the nation’s oldest university are responses to its failure to adequately address alleged antisemitism on campus, many critics argue Trump is targeting the Ivy League school over its defiance of the president’s “war on woke” and to bend other powerful institutions to his will. “While we are relieved that Harvard has not conceded to all of the Trump administration’s demands, we continue to be alarmed by the university’s repressive measures which have been aimed at silencing dissent and protest against genocide, and eliminating teaching and research about Palestine,” vigil co-organizer Sandra Susan Smith, who is a professor of criminal justice at Harvard Kennedy School, said Tuesday. “We call on Harvard to defend free speech, academic freedom, and to adopt an ethical investment policy to ensure that it is not funding human rights abuses with its $50 billion endowment,” she added. Vigil participants and UNICEF both called for an immediate cease-fire in Gaza. “The children of Gaza need protection. They need food, water, and medicine. They need a cease-fire,” said Beigbeder. “But more than anything, they need immediate, collective action to stop this once and for all.” Brett Wilkins is is staff writer for Common Dreams.

A close friend told the Mail that the 53-year-old 'panicked' when his car was surrounded by supporters, who opened his car door and 'grabbed his throat.' 'He was trying to get out of the parade and he has panicked,' the friend said. 'I believe he was doing someone a favour and dropping his wife's friend and her daughter off for an appointment. 'He has had the window smashed, people were trying to get into the car, he has had his throat grabbed and he has panicked.' The friend claimed the married father-of-three can't remember anything of the incident. 'He has phoned his wife to tell her what was going on and then he is said to have had a memory blackout,' he added. The married father-of-three has been in custody, held on suspicion of multiple attempted murders, driving under the influence of drugs and dangerous driving, since the horror incident as the Reds paraded their Premier League trophy on Monday night. Some 79 people were injured, with 50 needing hospital treatment. The youngest victim was just nine and the eldest 78 - with all victims believed to be British - police revealed today. Your browser does not support iframes. The man who was driving the car in Liverpool. Police are still interviewing a suspect The driver suspected of mowing down fans at Liverpool Football Club's victory parade is a 'lovely' family man who runs his own business. Pictured: The incident unfolding on Monday The 53-year-old, who is being quizzed by detectives on suspicion of multiple attempted murders, driving under the influence of drugs and dangerous driving Shocking video footage showed supporters being catapulted off the bonnet of the Ford Galaxy as it tailgated an ambulance through a roadblock and ploughed into crowds on Water Street, close to the famous Royal Liver Building, just after 6pm. Four people were left trapped under the wheels. But the man's friend said he was baffled by police suggestions that he was high on drugs. He confirmed he previously served in the military and added: 'He hasn't had a drink for 20-plus years and I cannot believe he had taken drugs. That is just not him. 'It is completely out of character. He is a nice lad. He has a heart of gold. I have only just found out and I feel a bit sick.' According to his LinkedIn, the driver served with the marines as a commando in the 1990s before reading psychology and maths at a Russell Group university. The keen runner has since held various management positions as a network security consultant, including one for several years at an NHS Trust, while company records show that he previously ran a number of businesses. He now works in cyber security. According to social media, he also enjoyed various holidays with his children and wife of 20 years, who posted pictures online of their trips abroad, including to Disneyland and Orlando. The friend added: 'It is weird for me as a friend because I've seen the video and all the comments. Then I've heard the other side and it puts a completely different perspective on what happened.' Police forensics officers work at the scene on Water Street in Liverpool, north-west England on May 27, 2025, where a car ploughed in to crowds that had gathered Police officers cover area with an inflatable tent to preserve evidence Police officers walk along Water Street near the Liver Building in Liverpool city centre The friend claimed the driver's wife, who is a Sunday school teacher, and children had since left the £300,000 family home, on a smart estate in West Derby, a suburb in the city. Today a mechanic who serviced the Ford Galaxy involved in the attack also said he was shocked when he saw the vehicle on the television news. Steven, who asked for his surname not to be disclosed, said: 'I saw the pictures on the telly and just went 'Oh my God' I know that car. 'I had serviced it three months ago and there were no problems with it and I took it to the garage for and MOT certificate. 'The bloke who came round was with his wife and eldest kid, he was very proud of his car, it was his pride and joy, and he kept it immaculate. 'I work with cars, and you get a feel for them when you look inside, it tells you a lot about a person and his was immaculate. 'What I also remember is that he had a picture of his wife and kids on the dashboard as well, and I could sense this guy was a family man. 'I saw the footage about two hours after it all happened and recognised it immediately, and I recognised him as well and I thought 'Oh wow, what was he thinking'. Jack Trotter, who escaped with injuries to his leg and back, feared his young son would become fatherless as the Ford Galaxy bore down on him The crowd scramble to bring the car to a stop as bystanders lean into the vehicle In footage shared widely on social media, one spectator was seen kicking and punching the car which then reversed into him The mechanic added: 'I just don't know why he did what he did, I can only think he must have just panicked (because) his car was getting smashed up. 'He was very athletic looking, and he obviously kept himself fit but we didn't really talk much about his life, it was about the car mainly. 'He certainly didn't strike me as the sort of guy who did drugs because he was so sporty looking and there was certainly no drugs paraphernalia in the car.'",

      "content": "The federal government is working to secure a charter flight to return a man who was removed from the U.S. back to America so he can have proper due process proceedings, the Justice Department said in court documents filed Wednesday. Last week, U.S. District Judge Brian Murphy ordered the man, only known by the initials O.C.G., to be returned to the United States after he found that necessary due process steps in his removal proceedings were \"ignored\" by the Trump administration. O.C.G.'s attorneys argued that he has no criminal history and sought asylum in the United States after multiple violent attacks against him in his native country of Guatemala. In March 2024, O.C.G. entered the United States illegally and was deported. After making it back to the United States again last year, he presented himself to Border Patrol for asylum proceedings. An immigration judge found in February 2025 that O.C.G. would face serious harm if he were sent back to Guatemala and ordered a \"withholding of removal\" that barred deportation back to his home country. Two days after the immigration judge's February decision, O.C.G. says he was placed on a bus and removed without due process to Mexico, where his attorneys said he was previously held for ransom and raped during his second attempt to get to the United States. He submitted evidence at his immigration hearing of his experiences in Mexico, and as a result the immigration judge said that O.C.G. could not be removed to a country other than Guatemala without additional due process. After O.C.G. was sent to Mexico by the United States, Mexican authorities removed him to Guatemala, where he remains in hiding, according to court documents. \"[The] immigration judge told O.C.G.— consistent with this Court's understanding of the law—that he could not be removed to a country other than his native Guatemala, at least not without some additional steps in the process,\" Murphy wrote in his order last week. \"Those necessary steps, and O.C.G.'s pleas for help, were ignored.\" Murphy had previously ordered additional fact finding in the case, after the Trump administration submitted a declaration under oath that O.C.G. told government officials that he had no fear of being sent to Mexico. O.C.G had previously submitted a declaration to the court stating that he was told at the last minute before his removal that he was being sent to Mexico, and that he was denied a request to speak to his attorneys beforehand. The Justice Department admitted to Murphy that there was no witness who could verify the government's account of O.C.G.'s removal under oath and the declaration was made in error. \"The only evidence before the Court therefore is O.C.G.'s uncontroverted assertion that he was given no notice of his transfer to Mexico and no opportunity to explain why it would be dangerous to send him there,\" Murphy wrote in his order mandating the man's return. \"Defendants' retraction of their prior sworn statement makes inexorable the already-strong conclusion that O.C.G. is likely to succeed in showing that his removal lacked any semblance of due process,\" the judge added. The Trump administration's push to ramp up deportations has drawn other scrutiny from other federal judges who argue deportees aren't being given enough due process. Another judge ordered the Trump administration to \"facilitate\" the return of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who the government admitted was sent to El Salvador in error. The Supreme Court affirmed that ruling, but Abrego Garcia remains in a Salvadoran prison, and the Trump administration says it's up to that country's government to return him.",

Jeanine Pirro in the Oval Office of the White House, May 28, 2025 in Washington. A federal appeals court on Thursday temporarily delayed Wednesday's court order blocking President Donald Trump's tariffs, reinstating them at least for the time being. The United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit issued an administrative stay of the decision while it considers Trump's appeal. The administration earlier Thursday urged the New York-based Court of International Trade to delay its order, warning that enforcement of the ruling will cause a \"foreign policy disaster scenario.\" In an opinion on Wednesday, the three-judge panel struck down Trump's global tariffs as \"contrary to law.\" President Donald Trump speaks during a swearing in ceremony for interim U.S. Attorney for Washington, D.C. Jeanine Pirro in the Oval Office of the White House, May 28, 2025 in Washington. Andrew Harnik/Getty Images The judges found that the International Emergency Economic Powers Act -- which Trump used to enact his tariffs -- does not give him the \"unlimited\" power to levy tariffs like the president has in recent months. \"The President's assertion of tariff-making authority in the instant case, unbounded as it is by any limitation in duration or scope, exceeds any tariff authority delegated to the President under IEEPA. The Worldwide and Retaliatory tariffs are thus ultra vires and contrary to law,\" the judges wrote. According to the judges, Congress, not the president, has the authority to impose tariffs under most circumstances, and Trump's tariffs do not meet the limited condition of an \"unusual and extraordinary threat\" that would allow him to act alone. Trump took to his social media platform on Thursday to condemn the judges' decision. \"Where do these initial three Judges come from? How is it possible for them to have potentially done such damage to the United States of America? Is it purely a hatred of 'TRUMP?' What other reason could it be?,\" the president wrote. He went on to say that he hopes the Supreme Court reverses this \"horrible, Country threatening decision\" by the Court of International Trade. Notably, one of the judges, Judge Timothy Reif, was nominated by Trump. A second federal court on Thursday also determined that Trump's global were \"unlawful.\" U.S. District Judge Rudolph Contreras said in an order the International Economic Emergency Economic Powers Act does not give the president the power to impose most of his recent tariffs. Notably, the decision from Contreras – an Obama appointee – only restricts the Trump administration's ability to collect tariffs from the two companies that filed the lawsuit, Learning Resources, Inc., and hand2mind, Inc. The Department of Justice on Thursday requested a stay to Wednesday's ruling, saying it's needed \"to avoid immediate irreparable harm to United States foreign policy and national security.\" \"It is critical, for the country's national security and the President's conduct of ongoing, delicate diplomatic efforts, that the Court stay its judgment. The harm to the conduct of foreign affairs from the relief ordered by the Court could not be greater,\" lawyers with the Department of Justice argued. According to the administration, the court order would strip the president of leverage in trade negotiations, imperil the trade deals already reached, and make the country vulnerable to countries that \"feel a renewed boldness to take advantage of\" the current situation. Responding to the ruling, White House spokesman Kush Desai evoked the trade deficit and said, \"It is not for unelected judges to decide how to properly address a national emergency,\" adding that that the administration is committed to using \"every lever of executive power to address this crisis.\" The Trump administration had quickly filed a notice of appeal to challenge Wednesday's decision. The case now heads to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit where they could ask for a stay of the order. The Court of International Trade issued the decision across two cases -- one filed by a group of small businesses and another filed by 12 Democratic attorneys general. Nevada Attorney General Aaron Ford called the ruling \"a win for the rule of law and for Nevadans' pocketbooks.\" \"I am extremely pleased with the court's decision to strike down these tariffs; they were both unlawful and economically destructive,\" he said. \"The president had no legal authority to impose these tariffs, and his unlawful actions would have caused billions of dollars of damage to the American economy.\" Since Trump announced sweeping tariffs on more than 50 countries in April, his administration has faced half a dozen lawsuits challenging the president's ability to impose tariffs without the approval of Congress. New York Attorney General Letitia James called the decision a \"major victory for our efforts to uphold the law and protect New Yorkers from illegal policies that threaten American jobs and economy.\" \"The law is clear: no president has the power to single-handedly raise taxes whenever they like. These tariffs are a massive tax hike on working families and American businesses that would have led to more inflation, economic damage to businesses of all sizes, and job losses across the country if allowed to continue,\" James' statement continued. Lawyers for the small businesses alleged that the International Emergency Economic Powers Act -- which Trump invoked to impose the tariffs -- does not give the president the right to issue \"across-the-board worldwide tariffs,\" and that Trump's justification for the tariffs was invalid. \"His claimed emergency is a figment of his own imagination,\" the lawsuit said. \"Trade deficits, which have persisted for decades without causing economic harm, are not an emergency.\" During a hearing earlier this month, a group of three judges -- who were appointed by presidents Obama, Trump and Reagan -- pushed a lawyer for the small businesses to provide a legal basis to override the tariffs. While a different court in the 1970s determined that the Trading with the Enemy Act of 1917 -- the law that preceded the International Emergency Economic Powers Act -- gave the president the right to impose tariffs, no court has weighed whether the president can impose tariffs unilaterally under the IEEPA. During a May 13 hearing, Jeffrey Schwab, a lawyer from the conservative Liberty Justice Center representing the plaintiffs, argued that Trump's purported emergency to justify the tariffs is far short of what is required under the law. \"I'm asking this court to be an umpire and call a strike; you're asking me, well, where's the strike zone? Is it at the knees or slightly below the knees?\" Schwab argued. \"I'm saying it's a wild pitch and it's on the other side of the batter and hits the backstop, so we don't need to debate that.\" The ruling marks the first time a federal court has issued a ruling on the legality of Trump's tariffs. In May, a federal judge in Florida nominated by Trump suggested the president has the authority to unilaterally impose tariffs, but opted to transfer the case to the Court of International Trade. -ABC News' Hannah Demissie contributed to this report.",
