Israel is currently under investigation for the crime of genocide by the International Court of Justice, while accused war criminals ‚Äî including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ‚Äî are now officially wanted by the International Criminal Court. The Israeli genocide has been largely defended, supported, and financed by Washington and a few other Western powers. (PC, Anadolu)
