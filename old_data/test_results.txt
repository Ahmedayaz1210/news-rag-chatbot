Scott Horton ("NATO Membership for Ukraine Was Always Russia's Red Line", 2025-06-01) notes that the US stance is driven by a desire to dictate when the war ends, stating "The U.S. ought not dictate to Kyiv when it should move to the negotiating track to end this war."

The US should not use sanctions to influence the direction of Syrian politics, as this can prolong conflict. (Daniel Larison, "Leave Syria Alone")
The US should remove all impediments to foreign investment and reconstruction in Syria and keep its hands off the country. (Daniel Larison, "Leave Syria Alone")
The US should take a stand regarding the limits of the president's war powers and challenge the constitutionality of the Alien Enemies Act. (Ray McGovern, "Neocons Try Again in Syria")
The US has been bombing Muslim forces in Lebanon, Bosnia, and Iraq without authorization, making these actions gratuitous wars of aggression. (Ray McGovern, "Neocons Try Again in Syria")

The GHF's system is designed to restrict aid to only one part of Gaza, leaving other dire needs unmet. ("The GHF 'restricts aid to only one part of Gaza while leaving other dire needs unmet', UN humanitarian chief Tom Fletcher said at the Security Council last week.")
The GHF has been accused of using its aid distribution system as a tool for Israel to control and contain the population, rather than providing genuine humanitarian assistance.

Question 27: How do different authors characterize the role of Congress in war powers?
Expected Answer: Multiple perspectives on constitutional war-making authority
Actual: "The articles provide several perspectives on the role of Congress in war powers.
Daniel Larison writes: "not wait for Congress to invoke the law based on a threatened or ongoing invasion or predatory incursion." (Source: Article 3, Author unknown) This suggests that he believes the president has inherent authority to repel sudden attacks and does not necessarily need congressional approval.
He also notes that "the position adopted by Trump's opponents is weakened further because Congress has allowed previous presidents to run amok for decades waging undeclared wars in multiple countries." (Source: Article 3, Author unknown) This implies that Larison thinks Congress has failed to effectively check the president's war powers.
In contrast, another author notes that "the authority of Congress to declare war has become little more than an archaic historical curiosity. It is mighty late for Trump's opponents to take a stand regarding the limits of the president's war powers." (Source: Article 3, Author unknown) This suggests that this author believes Congress's role in declaring war is largely ceremonial and not effective in checking the president's power.
A third author notes that "the Constitution gives Congress, not the president, the power to declare war, so the president must wait for democratic debate and a congressional vote to invoke the Alien Enemies Act based on a declared war." (Source: Article 3, Author unknown) This implies that this author believes Congress has a more significant role in declaring war than the president does.
Overall, the articles present different perspectives on the role of Congress in war powers, with some arguing for greater congressional involvement and others suggesting that the president has inherent authority to make decisions about war."
