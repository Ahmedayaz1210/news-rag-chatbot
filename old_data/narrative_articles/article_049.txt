The man being questioned over the horror at Liverpool Football Club's victory parade is a former Royal Marine commando who was dropping a friend off as a favour when he ploughed into fans, it emerged today. A close friend told the Mail that the 53-year-old 'panicked' when his car was surrounded by supporters, who opened his car door and 'grabbed his throat.' 'He was trying to get out of the parade and he has panicked,' the friend said. 'I believe he was doing someone a favour and dropping his wife's friend and her daughter off for an appointment. 'He has had the window smashed, people were trying to get into the car, he has had his throat grabbed and he has panicked.' The friend claimed the married father-of-three can't remember anything of the incident. 'He has phoned his wife to tell her what was going on and then he is said to have had a memory blackout,' he added.

He now works in cyber security. According to social media, he also enjoyed various holidays with his children and wife of 20 years, who posted pictures online of their trips abroad, including to Disneyland and Orlando.

'The bloke who came round was with his wife and eldest kid, he was very proud of his car, it was his pride and joy, and he kept it immaculate. 'I work with cars, and you get a feel for them when you look inside, it tells you a lot about a person and his was immaculate. 'What I also remember is that he had a picture of his wife and kids on the dashboard as well, and I could sense this guy was a family man.

'He was very athletic looking, and he obviously kept himself fit but we didn't really talk much about his life, it was about the car mainly. 'He certainly didn't strike me as the sort of guy who did drugs because he was so sporty looking and there was certainly no drugs paraphernalia in the car.'
