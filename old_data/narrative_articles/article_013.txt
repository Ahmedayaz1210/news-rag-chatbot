The EU Council has launched an initiative that will support member states in their joint defense procurement loans. The union’s Security Action for Europe (SAFE) program will finance member states’ urgent and large-scale investments in the European defense technological and industrial base. An estimated 150 million euros ($169 million) will be disbursed to interested member states upon request and on the basis of national plans. SAFE aims to boost production capacity, address existing capability gaps, and ensure that defense equipment is available when needed. Priority defense equipment to be funded by the cause includes ammunition and missiles, artillery systems, maritime surface and underwater capabilities, and drones and anti-drone systems. SAFE is part of the European Commission’s ReArm Europe Plan/Readiness 2030, which aims to leverage more than 800 billion euros ($903 million) in defense spending. Funding Defense The EU’s recent funding projects focus on bolstering security capabilities as a means to counter potential destabilization. Earlier this month, the alliance allocated 910 million euros ($1.02 billion) under the 2024 European Defence Fund to bolster the continent’s defense industry, with successful proposals now selected for implementation. The funding targets key capability gaps, such as force mobility and drone defense, through innovation and collaboration across European science and industry. In March, it pledged 60 million euros ($63 million) in defense assistance for Moldova through the European Peace Facility funding mechanism. Moldova has encountered security threats amid the neighboring Russo-Ukrainian war, finding fragments of Russian military equipment used in battle.
